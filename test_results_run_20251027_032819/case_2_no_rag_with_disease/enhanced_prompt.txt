        **Objective:** Create a complete, personalized 1-day meal plan in a valid JSON format.

}

        **Instructions:**
        1.  **Generate a 1-day meal plan.** Include breakfast, lunch, dinner, and one snack.
        2.  **CRITICAL: Adhere to Nutritional Targets:** The nutrition targets are MANDATORY and must be met with high precision:
           - Total daily calories: 2950 kcal (± 50 kcal tolerance)
           - Total daily protein: 220.0g (± 5g tolerance) - HIGHEST PRIORITY
           - Total daily carbs: 375.0g (± 10g tolerance)
           - Total daily fat: 80.0g (± 5g tolerance)
        3.  **Macro Planning Strategy:** Calculate protein content for each meal FIRST, then distribute carbs and fats proportionally.
        4.  **Follow Preferences:** Incorporate the user's preferences, dietary restrictions, and allergies.
        5.  **Validation:** Before finalizing, verify all totals match targets within tolerance.
        6.  **JSON Output:** The final output must be a single, valid JSON object. Do not include any text, explanations, or markdown before or after the JSON object.

        **INGREDIENT SERVING FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:**
        - MUST include proper measurement units for every ingredient
        - Common units: g (grams), oz (ounces), ml (milliliters), cups, tbsp, tsp, lb, kg, pieces, slices, whole
        - Examples:
          ✓ "150g" or "150 g" for Chicken Breast
          ✓ "2 large" for Eggs
          ✓ "1 cup" for Rice  
          ✓ "2 tbsp" for Olive Oil
          ✓ "1 lb" for Ground Beef
          ✓ "3 slices" for Bread
          ✗ "150 serving" - NEVER use "serving" as a unit
          ✗ "150" - MUST include unit
        - All ingredient serving values must have proper units for accurate nutrition tracking

The weight loss process is slow and complex, and involves lifestyle changes with an emphasis on nutritional therapy, physical activity practice, psychological i...\n**Summary:** For effective weight management and overall health, focus on a balanced diet rich in whole grains, lean meats, low-fat dairy, fruits, and vegetables. Avoid high consumption of ultraprocessed foods high in fats, sugars, and energy density, as well as large portion sizes. Include foods with an emphasis on an energy deficit to support weight loss efforts. Be cautious of fad diets promoting quick fixes or the exclusion of entire food groups, particularly those rich in carbohydrates. Emphasize behavioral aspects like motivational interviewing to develop sustainable healthy eating habits for long-term success.\n**Citation:** \"Position statement on nutrition therapy for overweight and obesity: nutrition department of the Brazilian association for the study of obesity and metabolic syndrome (ABESO\u00e2\u0080\u00942022)\".

Now, in 2020, we can put ourselves to the test and take a look back. Without a doubt we got it right with several of the key directions.

Emphasize a variety of nutrient-dense foods such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, seeds, and lean proteins to optimize metabolic processes and immune function. Consider meal combinations that enhance the bioavailability and synergistic effects of functional ingredients for maximum health benefits. Be mindful of portion sizes to maintain balance and prevent overconsumption, especially in individuals with risk factors for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity. Ensure a diverse and balanced diet to support homeostasis, reduce inflammation, and promote nutrition-related disease prevention, with a focus on human-based evidence for personalized dietary recommendations.\n**Citation:** \"Goals in Nutrition Science 2020-2025\".

Objectives: This review critically examines the current evidence on dietary strategies and or...\n**Summary:** Include a variety of whole-food-based interventions in meal planning for Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), such as the Mediterranean Diet, Specific Carbohydrate Diet, and plant-based diets. Consider incorporating exclusion diets like low-FODMAP, low-emulsifier, and low-sulfur diets to alleviate functional symptoms and potentially impact inflammatory activity. Encourage portion control and balanced meals to support nutrient adequacy and gastrointestinal health in individuals with IBD. Monitor portion sizes and meal frequency to prevent malnutrition and optimize outcomes, especially in perioperative and hospitalized patients with IBD. Avoid highly processed foods, sugary drinks, and excessive consumption of sugar, confectionery, and soft drinks, as these may increase the risk of IBD development or exacerbation.\n**Citation:** \"Dietary Interventions and Oral Nutritional Supplementation in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Current Evidence and Future Directions\".

Consume 5 servings of fruits and vegetables, particularly green leafy veggies, along with EVO oil and nuts. Incorporate fish, white meat, plant-based proteins, and eggs weekly, limiting red/processed meats to once a week. Avoid simple sugars, refined carbs, and a sedentary lifestyle, and consider personalized supplementation if needed. Engage in aerobic and resistance exercises 3-4 times a week for 30-40 minutes to support glucose management.\n**Citation:** \"A Narrative Review on Strategies for the Reversion of Prediabetes to Normoglycemia: Food Pyramid, Physical Activity, and Self-Monitoring Innovative Glucose Devices\".

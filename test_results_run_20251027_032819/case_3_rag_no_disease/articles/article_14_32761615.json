  "abstract": "Abstract Background After decades of decline since 2005, the global prevalence of undernourishment reverted and since 2015 has\u00c2\u00a0increased to levels seen in 2010 to 2011. The prevalence is highest in low\u00e2\u0080\u0090 and middle\u00e2\u0080\u0090income countries (LMICs), especially Africa and Asia. Food insecurity and associated undernutrition detrimentally affect health and socioeconomic development in the short and long term, for individuals, including children, and societies. Physical and economic access to food is crucial to ensure food security. Community\u00e2\u0080\u0090level interventions could be important to increase access to food in LMICs. Objectives To determine the effects of community\u00e2\u0080\u0090level interventions that aim to improve access to nutritious food in LMICs, for both the whole community and for disadvantaged or at\u00e2\u0080\u0090risk individuals or groups within a community, such as infants, children and women; elderly, poor or unemployed people; or minority groups. Search methods We searched for relevant studies in 16 electronic databases, including trial registries, from 1980 to September 2019, and updated the searches in six key databases in February 2020. We applied no language or publication status limits. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster randomised controlled trials (cRCTs) and prospective controlled studies (PCS). All population groups, adults and children, living in communities in LMICs exposed to community\u00e2\u0080\u0090level interventions aiming to improve food access were eligible for inclusion. We excluded studies that only included participants with specific diseases or conditions (e.g. severely malnourished children). Eligible interventions were broadly categorised into those that improved buying power (e.g. create income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation opportunities, cash transfer schemes); addressed food prices (e.g. vouchers and subsidies); addressed infrastructure and transport that affected physical access to food outlets; addressed the social environment and provided social support (e.g. social support from family, neighbours or government). Data collection and analysis Two authors independently screened\u00c2\u00a0titles and abstracts, and full texts of potentially eligible records, against the inclusion criteria. Disagreements were resolved through discussion or arbitration by a third author, if necessary. For each included study, two authors independently extracted data and a third author arbitrated disagreements. However, the outcome data were extracted by one author and checked by a biostatistician. We assessed risk of bias\u00c2\u00a0for all studies using the Effective Practice and Organization of Care (EPOC) risk of bias tool for studies with a separate control group. We conducted meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analyses if there was a minimum of two studies for interventions within the same category, reporting the same outcome measure and these were sufficiently homogeneous. Where we were able to meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analyse, we used the random\u00e2\u0080\u0090effects model to incorporate any existing heterogeneity. Where we were unable to conduct meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analyses, we synthesised using vote counting based on effect direction. Main results We included 59 studies, including 214 to 169,485 participants, and 300 to 124, 644 households, mostly from Africa and Latin America, addressing the following six intervention types (three studies assessed two different types of interventions). Interventions that improved buying power: Unconditional cash transfers (UCTs) (16 cRCTs, two RCTs, three PCSs): we found high\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence that UCTs improve food security and make little or no difference to cognitive function and development and low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence that UCTs may increase dietary diversity and may reduce stunting. The evidence was very uncertain about the effects of UCTs on the proportion of household expenditure on food, and on wasting. Regarding adverse outcomes, evidence from one trial indicates that UCTs reduce the proportion of infants who are overweight. Conditional cash transfers (CCTs) (nine cRCTs, five PCSs): we found high\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence that CCTs result in little to no difference in the proportion of household expenditure on food and that they slightly improve cognitive function in children; moderate\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence that CCTs probably slightly improve dietary diversity and low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence that they may make little to no difference to stunting or wasting. Evidence on adverse outcomes (two PCSs) shows that CCTs make no difference to the proportion of overweight children. Income generation interventions (six cRCTs, 11 PCSs): we found moderate\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence that income generation interventions probably make little or no difference to stunting or wasting; and low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence that they may result in little to no difference to food security or that they may improve dietary diversity in children, but not for households. Interventions that addressed food prices: Food vouchers (three cRCTs, one RCT): we found moderate\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence that food vouchers probably reduce stunting; and low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence that that they may improve dietary diversity slightly, and may result in little to no difference in wasting. Food and nutrition subsidies (one cRCT, three PCSs): we found low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence that food and nutrition subsidies may improve dietary diversity among school children. The evidence is very uncertain about the effects on household expenditure on healthy foods as a proportion of total expenditure on food (very low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence). Interventions that addressed the social environment: Social support interventions (one cRCT, one PCS): we found moderate\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence that community grants probably make little or no difference to wasting; low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence that they may make little or no difference to stunting. The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of village savings and loans on food security and dietary diversity. None of the included studies addressed the intervention category of infrastructure changes. In addition, none of the studies reported on one of the primary outcomes of this review, namely prevalence of undernourishment. Authors' conclusions The body of evidence indicates that UCTs can improve food security. Income generation interventions do not seem to make a difference for food security, but the evidence is unclear for the other interventions. CCTs, UCTs, interventions\u00c2\u00a0that help generate income, interventions that help minimise impact of food prices through food vouchers and subsidies can potentially improve dietary diversity. UCTs and food vouchers may have a potential impact on reducing stunting, but CCTs, income generation interventions or social environment interventions do not seem to make a difference on wasting or stunting. CCTs seem to positively impact cognitive function and development, but not UCTs, which may be due to school attendance, healthcare visits and other conditionalities associated with CCTs. Plain language summary Improving access to food in low\u00e2\u0080\u0090 and middle\u00e2\u0080\u0090income countries Review question We looked at the effect of community\u00e2\u0080\u0090level interventions to improve access to nutritious food in low\u00e2\u0080\u0090 and middle\u00e2\u0080\u0090income countries (LMICs) on people, households and communities. Background Food security exists when people have physical, social and economic access to sufficient, safe, nutritious foods to be healthy. The number of people who do not have enough to eat in the world has started increasing since 2015. Most of these people live in LMICs, especially in Asia and Africa. Not being able to access nutritious food, either because of not having enough money or because of not having somewhere to shop or find food near where people live, affects the health and socioeconomic situation of people and societies, both in the short and long term. Strategies focusing on communities may be important for increasing access to food in LMICs. Study characteristics We found 59 studies assessing different interventions in LMICs, including 214 to 169,485 participants and 300 to 124,644 households, mainly in Africa and Latin America. Many studies assessed cash transfers, which are welfare programmes where money is provided to households. Of these, 21 studies evaluated unconditional cash transfers, where there are no conditions for receiving the money, and 14 studies assessed conditional cash transfers, where there are specific conditions required to meet in order to receive the money. Seventeen studies looked at income generation interventions (for example, livestock management or self\u00e2\u0080\u0090help groups), four studies at food vouchers, four studies at providing food and nutrition subsidies, and two studies looked at social support interventions such as village savings and loans and community grant programmes. Search date The evidence is current to February 2020. Key results Interventions that improved buying power: Unconditional cash transfers improve food security and make little or no difference to cognitive function (thoughts and understanding) and development (high\u00e2\u0080\u0090quality evidence), may increase dietary diversity (variety of the foods that people or households eat from different food groups) and reduce stunting (poor growth) (low\u00e2\u0080\u0090quality evidence). It is very uncertain whether UCTs reduce the proportion of household expenditure on food and reduce wasting. Regarding adverse outcomes, evidence from one trial indicates that UCTs reduce the proportion of infants who are overweight. Conditional cash transfers make little to no difference in the proportion of household expenditure on food and slightly improve cognitive function in children (high\u00e2\u0080\u0090quality evidence), probably slightly improve dietary diversity (moderate\u00e2\u0080\u0090quality evidence), and may make little to no difference to stunting or wasting (low bodyweight) (low\u00e2\u0080\u0090quality evidence). Evidence on adverse outcomes (two studies) shows that CCTs make no difference to the proportion of overweight children. Income generation strategies make little or no difference to stunting or wasting (moderate\u00e2\u0080\u0090quality evidence), may result in little to no difference to food security and may improve dietary diversity in children but not for households (low\u00e2\u0080\u0090quality evidence). Interventions that addressed food prices: Food vouchers probably reduce stunting (moderate\u00e2\u0080\u0090quality evidence), may slightly improve dietary diversity and may result in little to no difference in wasting (low\u00e2\u0080\u0090quality evidence). Food and nutrition subsidies may improve dietary diversity among school children (low\u00e2\u0080\u0090quality evidence). We are very uncertain about the effects on household expenditure on healthy foods as a proportion of total expenditure on food (very low\u00e2\u0080\u0090quality evidence). Interventions that addressed the social environment: Social support interventions such as community grants probably make little to no difference to wasting (moderate\u00e2\u0080\u0090quality evidence) and may make little or no difference to stunting (low\u00e2\u0080\u0090quality evidence). We are very uncertain about the effects of village savings and loans on food security or dietary diversity (very low\u00e2\u0080\u0090quality evidence). None of the included studies addressed the intervention category of infrastructure changes and none of the included studies reported on one of the primary outcomes: prevalence of undernourishment. Some limitations of the review include not having all necessary information about what was measured (outcomes), judgements that had to be made regarding which outcome measures to report and inability to pool the results of all studies reporting on the same outcome. Another limitation was that we were unable to find out what specific intervention features enable or impede the effective implementation of the intervention.",

INTRO: Background INTRO: Description of the condition INTRO: Food security \"exists when all people, at all times, have physical, social and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life\" (FAO 2019). When these conditions are not met, the population and people within it\u00c2\u00a0are said to be food insecure. INTRO: Food insecurity and associated undernutrition affect health and socioeconomic development on different levels (Black 2013; Ecker 2012; Victora 2008). For adults, it has been associated with an increased risk of disability, morbidity and mortality, and with a decrease in income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation potential (Black 2008; Black 2013; Victora 2008). Food insecurity is also associated with mental health problems such as depression and anxiety, both in high\u00e2\u0080\u0090income as well as low\u00e2\u0080\u0090 and middle\u00e2\u0080\u0090income settings (Arenas 2019; Carter 2011; Cole 2011; Hadley 2006; Hadley 2008; Maynard 2018). Children who are affected may experience impaired physical and cognitive development, and decreased school performance (Black 2008; Black 2013; Liu 2012; Victora 2008). At the macro\u00e2\u0080\u0090level, undernutrition is associated with direct and indirect costs. Direct costs are due to increased healthcare costs for preventing and treating affected individuals (Black 2013; Victora 2008). Indirect costs are due to poor productivity and losses of human resources due to mental and physical under\u00e2\u0080\u0090performance and death (Victora 2008). Given these far\u00e2\u0080\u0090reaching consequences, and considering that food security is defined as a human right by the United Nations (FAO 2003), it is important to address food insecurity. INTRO: Building on the first 2010 to 2015 Millennium Development Goal (MDG), which was to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger, the second 2015 Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) aimed to end hunger by 2030 and sought to \"achieve food security and improve nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture\" (UN 2015). Progress towards this goal\u00c2\u00a0has been insufficient. Following decades of decline, the global prevalence of undernourishment, has, since 2015,\u00c2\u00a0increased to levels seen in 2010\u00e2\u0080\u00932011, approximately 11% (FAO 2019). Although this prevalence is highest in Asia, it has been sharply increasing in Africa which is now home to 30% of the world's undernourished population (FAO 2019). The global number of undernourished people, estimated at 820 million in 2018, has been steadily rising particularly in Africa, Latin America and Western Asia. Globally, the prevalence and number of stunted children under five years of age has decreased since 2012, although this is uneven as Africa and Asia account for more than 90% of stunted and wasted children globally (FAO 2019; SOWC 2019). Factors that have delayed improvements in rates of chronic hunger include the food price crisis of 2008, brought about by trade restrictions of major food exporters, biofuels policies and increased commodity speculation, among others (Ecker 2012). The higher demand for food due to changing dietary patterns and growing population, and food price increases and volatility due to climate change are other factors that will contribute to food insecurity in the long term (Ecker 2012). INTRO: Food security is a complex concept that encompasses several different dimensions (Ecker 2012; FAO 2013; FAO 2019; Gross 2000), where 1. food availability refers to the quantity of food that is physically available in the relevant vicinity of a population during a given period (ACF\u00e2\u0080\u0090IN 2008); 2. food access is a measure of the capacity of a household to acquire sufficient and appropriate foods to ensure a diet that is diverse, nutrient\u00e2\u0080\u0090rich and safe, and that satisfies the nutrient needs of its members during a given period, which is often influenced by the proximity and price of food (ACF\u00e2\u0080\u0090IN 2008; WHO 2013); 3. food utilisation refers to the intake of food by the people within a household and how the body assimilates the nutrients physiologically; and 4. food stability introduces the condition of time to the food security concept, that is it refers to chronic or transient food insecurity (FAO 2003). Chronic food insecurity refers to long\u00e2\u0080\u0090term, persistent lack of food and results from continued problems with structural poverty, relating to the inability of the labour market to produce enough jobs to keep people out of poverty, low incomes and with lack of sufficient social safety nets to assist the poor (Ecker 2012; FAO 2003; Rank 2003). In contrast, transient food insecurity refers to food and nutrient shortages during certain periods of food crises due to natural disasters, economic collapse or conflict (Ecker 2012; FAO 2003). In addition, the nutrition dimension was added to the food security concept at the 2009 World Food Summit (Ecker 2012) as food insecurity is associated with nutrient deficiencies and poor nutritional outcomes. Furthermore, food and nutrient intake interact in a bidirectional manner with health status (Ecker 2012). This means that nutritional status is the primary measure of food security. INTRO: The four dimensions of food security operate at different levels of influence, although these are often inter\u00e2\u0080\u0090related (Ecker 2012; Gross 2000). At the macro\u00e2\u0080\u0090level (national, regional, global) and meso\u00e2\u0080\u0090level (community), food security issues are mainly related to food availability and stability, whereas at the micro\u00e2\u0080\u0090level they are mainly related to food access and utilisation by households and individuals (Ecker 2012; Gross 2000; Pinstrup\u00e2\u0080\u0090Andersen 2009). Food security in one level does not ensure food security at another level (Gross 2000). For example, food might be available at the national level but not accessible for certain disadvantaged communities or districts, or among lower income or otherwise marginalised population groups. In Ghana, despite improvements in reducing poverty and increasing food production, there has been less progress in reducing undernutrition and disparities remain (FAO 2013; Hjelm 2013). There, poorer households and those headed by women tend to be more food insecure due to their low\u00e2\u0080\u0090diversity diets compared with the wealthier or male\u00e2\u0080\u0090headed households (FAO 2013; Hjelm 2013). In Nepal, there is still widespread undernutrition despite the country producing sufficient food, and those living in rural areas are at a higher risk of food insecurity and have a higher prevalence of undernutrition and stunting in children as poor infrastructures and poverty limit their physical and economic access to food (FAO 2013; MOHP 2012). Furthermore, households might have access to food, but this does not guarantee that all individuals in the household are able to access and utilise sufficient amounts of good quality and safe food. This is because the distribution of food within the household may be influenced by cultural beliefs, practices, attitudes, gender and age\u00e2\u0080\u0090specific roles and responsibilities, as well as decision\u00e2\u0080\u0090making hierarchies (Gittelsohn 2003; Pinstrup\u00e2\u0080\u0090Andersen 2009; Renzaho 2010). INTRO: In addition to the burden of undernutrition, low\u00e2\u0080\u0090 and middle\u00e2\u0080\u0090income countries (LMICs) also have high rates of overweight and obesity that are on the rise (Hossain 2007; Popkin 2012; Subramanian 2011). In an analysis of data from 54 LMICs, 27% of women were overweight (Subramanian 2011). The prevalence of overweight in 2008 ranged from approximately 18% in low\u00e2\u0080\u0090income countries to 59% in upper middle\u00e2\u0080\u0090income countries, with a mean prevalence of 28% in the African region (WHO 2010). Among children under five years of age, the prevalence of overweight and obesity is also increasing, with 12.9% of boys and 13.4% of girls overweight in LMICs in 2013 (Ng 2014). Most of this burden is concentrated in Africa and Asia, regions that accounted for almost three\u00e2\u0080\u0090quarters of the global share of overweight children in 2018 (FAO 2019; SOWC 2019). The increased rates of overweight and obesity are associated with the nutrition transition and poorer\u00e2\u0080\u0090quality diets increasingly consisting of more affordable processed foods, high intake of refined sugars and fats, and increased intake of food away from home, further exacerbated by decreased levels of physical activity (Popkin 2012; SOWC 2019). In LMICs, the consumption of processed or junk foods and sugar\u00e2\u0080\u0090sweetened beverages has increased, with 54% of the global consumption of soft drinks 1997 and 2010 occurring in LMICs (Basu 2013). These dietary patterns are partly the result of high food prices, which cause consumers, particularly those in poorer households, to buy less\u00e2\u0080\u0090expensive foods. These are often energy dense (higher in calories) and less nutritious (containing fewer nutrients per serving size). Consumption of these foods is, therefore, associated with increased risk of overweight, obesity and micronutrient deficiencies. In this context, it is important to consider the quantity and quality of the food intake in any intervention. INTRO: Description of the intervention INTRO: Scoping review: preparation for this systematic review INTRO: The complexity of food security allows for a wide range of interventions addressing its different dimensions at varying levels of influence. In order to better conceptualise the framework for our review with regards to the type(s) of intervention(s) to assess, the eligibility criteria for study selection and the outcomes to be assessed, we conducted a scoping review of existing systematic reviews of interventions addressing food security in LMICs (more information about the methods is available on request). INTRO: We included 29 systematic reviews in the scoping review (references available on request). Fourteen reviews addressed food availability, mainly assessing food production interventions and food utilisation (13 reviews, including five which also addressed availability), specifically around issues of nutrition education for people to improve their dietary intake. Seven reviews addressed food access. The scoping review also revealed that the included reviews were unclear regarding the description of participants and settings, types of interventions and comparisons, or the outcomes they would assess (Table 7). The quality of reviews varied considerably, some with very low\u00e2\u0080\u0090quality scores using the AMSTAR tool (Shea 2009). TABLE: Summary of PICOS and of AMSTAR scores of included systematic reviews, and how existing reviews informed the PICOS of a new Cochrane Review TABLE: Domain\tFinding\tHow it informed our review question or methods\t \tSetting\t12 reviews did not specify the setting11 reviews stated the community as the setting3 reviews stated the setting was LMICs3 reviews specified a school as the setting\tWe chose the community as the setting, defined as a group of people with diverse characteristics who were linked by social ties, share common perspectives and engage in joint action in geographical locations or settings (MacQueen 2001).\t \tParticipants\t5 reviews did not specify the types of participants for inclusion11 reviews included infants and children (up to school\u00e2\u0080\u0090aged children)1 review included adults and adolescents6 reviews included pregnant women or mothers in the immediate postpartum period. 1 of these also targeted other adults who could be linked to women who may have breastfed. Many of these were assessing interventions on breastfeeding or complementary feeding.1 review included only parents of children aged 2\u00e2\u0080\u00935 years, as it assessed influence of parenting practices on children's dietary habits2 reviews included all people living in a community3 reviews included only poor people who were recipients of some service, e.g. recipients of a government conditional cash\u00e2\u0080\u0090transfer programme\tAs existing reviews specifically addressed specific high\u00e2\u0080\u0090risk groups, we did not focus on these. Instead, we included all individuals across all ages that belonged to the community where relevant interventions had been implemented.\t \tIntervention (including its duration)\t14 reviews addressed interventions related to the availability of food, 5 of which also assessed interventions influencing utilisation of food, such as nutrition education13 reviews assessed interventions addressing food utilisation7 reviews assessed interventions addressing access to food (2 of which had a low AMSTAR score of 4)28 reviews did not specify the duration of the intervention, and only 1 included interventions with a minimum duration of 3 months. As a result, the duration and the follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up times of the interventions varied considerably within and across reviews\tOf the 14 reviews that addressed food availability, 5 also assessed food utilisation (e.g. combination of community gardens and nutrition education). As fewer reviews addressed food access, we included interventions that had addressed this dimension of food security.We included interventions with any duration but extracted outcomes that were measured \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 3 months after implementation.\t \tControl\t18 reviews did not specify a control group6 reviews compared the intervention with either no intervention, an alternative intervention or placebo3 reviews did not have any control group2 reviews stated that included studies needed to have a control group, but did not specify further\tWe included studies in which these interventions, individually or in combination, were compared to no intervention or to other eligible intervention.\t \tOutcomes assessed\tThe specific outcomes assessed across the included reviews varied considerably and often they were not clearly specified at the outset.The most common and important outcomes reported in these reviews were related to dietary intake, anthropometric measurements, and biochemical and clinical indicators, to describe the impact of the intervention on nutritional status. Other outcomes measured included food purchase or expenditure, food production, morbidity and mortality, and breastfeeding initiation rates or duration.Often, reviews measured the same outcome in different ways. For example, anthropometric indicators assessed differed, as did their classifications, across the included reviews. This makes it difficult to compare results across reviews and to reach a conclusion about the effectiveness of a specific intervention.\tThe most commonly specified outcomes measured food and nutrition security, and nutritional status. We also focused on these outcomes. Examples included: diet diversity scores and hunger measures; and anthropometric, biochemical and dietary intake indicators. We clearly defined, a priori, the specific outcome measures and metrics that we included in our review.\t \tStudy designs\t11 reviews did not specify which study designs they would include3 reviews included only RCTs1 review included only CCTs1 review included only impact evaluations13 reviews included a variety of study designs, which included \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 2 of: RCTs, BAS, quasi\u00e2\u0080\u0090RCTs, analytical cohort studies, ITS, CCTs, randomised field trials and CSSHowever, the definitions of the study design labels used were not always clear and varied across the included reviews.\tThe study design labels used varied across included reviews and were not always clearly defined.We included both randomised and non\u00e2\u0080\u0090randomised studies, as we expect that existing RCTs in the area of food security would be scarce. We wanted to include the best available evidence for our review question. We clearly defined the type of study designs included in our review.\t \tSearch strategies\tMost reviews ran comprehensive searches. They used a comprehensive set of keywords and searched a variety of relevant databases. Only 5 reviews did not indicate search terms either in the text or in an appendix.2 reviews conducted searches until 201211 reviews searched until 2010\u00e2\u0080\u009320119 reviews searched before 20107 reviews did not specify the date of the last search\tOur review included updated searches across a variety of relevant databases and websites. We drew on common keywords used across these included reviews.\t \tReporting\tThe methods sections of most reviews were often not reported clearly. The reporting of results in these reviews, in terms of characteristics of included studies, was also poor.\tPoor reporting of the characteristics of included studies makes it difficult to assess the context in which these results were obtained. Thus, it is difficult to generalise the results.We clearly reported on the characteristics of included studies, so that the context in which the interventions were implemented was clearly understood.\t \tAMSTAR scores\t9 reviews were of low quality (AMSTAR score: 0\u00e2\u0080\u00934)11 reviews were of moderate quality (AMSTAR score: 5\u00e2\u0080\u00938)8 reviews were of high quality (AMSTAR score: 9\u00e2\u0080\u009311)1 review did not have a score as it did not include any studies\tOf the 8 high\u00e2\u0080\u0090quality reviews, 5 assessed interventions that aimed to improve food availability or utilisation (or both), and 3 assessed interventions addressing food access. The other 2 included reviews that addressed food access were of low quality (AMSTAR = 4).We contributed to the evidence base on interventions addressing food access by producing a high\u00e2\u0080\u0090quality systematic review that assessed the effectiveness of the interventions on relevant outcomes, such as nutritional status. TABLE: BAS: before\u00e2\u0080\u0090and\u00e2\u0080\u0090after study; CCT: controlled clinical trial; CSS: cross\u00e2\u0080\u0090sectional study; ITS: interrupted time series; LMIC: low\u00e2\u0080\u0090 and middle\u00e2\u0080\u0090income country; RCT: randomised controlled trial. INTRO: Interventions selected based on scoping review results INTRO: Based on the findings of the scoping review, we decided to focus this Cochrane Review on community\u00e2\u0080\u0090level interventions that aim to improve access to nutritious food in LMICs; as we found that there are fewer reviews addressing food access compared to food availability or utilisation. Furthermore, we know that in many areas of LMICs, nutritious food is available at a national level, but physical distance and financial constraints prevent thousands of people from accessing the food (FAO 2013). As explained above, increased intake of ultraprocessed food products and sugar\u00e2\u0080\u0090sweetened beverages has contributed to the rise in overweight and obesity in LMICs and poor diet quality is also responsible for micronutrient deficiencies. Thus, interventions should aim to improve access to nutritious food. Nutritious foods can be defined as those that are nutrient dense, that is providing substantial amounts of vitamins and minerals (Pennington 2007). This includes fresh or minimally processed foods from the different food groups, such as whole grains, lean meats, dairy products, legumes, vegetables and fruits, and excludes ultraprocessed products and sugar\u00e2\u0080\u0090sweetened beverages that provide empty calories (Drewnowski 2005; Ministry of Health of Brazil 2014). INTRO: The interventions addressing food access include those aimed at infrastructure and transport, food prices, the social environment, coping strategies and buying power. In our scoping review, we found no systematic reviews addressing infrastructure and transport or coping strategies. We did, however, find reviews focusing on food prices, social environment and buying power, but these did not assess all relevant outcomes and not all were of good quality. Therefore, we included all these interventions addressing food access in this review. INTRO: We chose to assess community\u00e2\u0080\u0090level interventions because every community member residing in the setting where they are implemented can potentially benefit from them (McLeroy 2003). These types of interventions have been shown to be effective (Bhandari 2003; Mohammadifard 2009), and include interventions that take place across cities or within community institutions, such as schools, neighbourhoods, churches or work sites. The intervention may involve individuals, families, organisations or public policy. INTRO: This review focused on LMICs as they experience the greatest burden from food insecurity and malnutrition and because another Cochrane Review will address food security in developed countries (Burns 2010). INTRO: How the intervention might work INTRO: Based on the literature cited in the above sections, and on guidance on how to use logic models in systematic reviews (Rohwer 2016), we developed a logic model that illustrates how interventions addressing food insecurity might work in improving the nutritional status of individuals (Figure 1). In this model, we present interventions that address food availability, access and utilisation. The interventions may operate at different levels of influence, including the macro (national, regional, global), meso (community) and micro (household and individual) levels. As mentioned above, food security at one level does not ensure food security at another level (Gross 2000). As our review focused on chronic food insecurity, the logic model does not include interventions that address transient food insecurity. FIG: Food security logic model: how interventions influence food and nutritional security. INTRO: Although this logic model encompasses three dimensions of food security \u00e2\u0080\u0093 availability, access and utilisation \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we only explored how interventions addressing access to food may lead to food and nutrition security. As mentioned above, access to food concerns the ability of households (and communities) to acquire sufficient and appropriate foods to ensure a diet that is diverse, nutrient dense and safe, and that satisfies the nutrient needs of its members (ACF\u00e2\u0080\u0090IN 2008; WHO 2013). This logic model provides examples of interventions that address the determinants of food access. These include income\u00e2\u0080\u0090 or employment\u00e2\u0080\u0090generating opportunities, coping strategies (e.g. borrowing money from a community fund, childcare), social grants, food price policies and regulations, rural infrastructure development, and food or cash vouchers. The direct effects of these interventions include increased financial resources in the household, reduced food prices, increased social support and assistance (e.g. from family, neighbours or the government), having adequate facilities to store food, and ensuring that there is affordable transport to food outlets as well as existence of food outlets closer to where people live (Cotta 2013; Ecker 2012; FAO 2012). Many of these factors interact with each other. For example, having more money may enable the household to buy a fridge to store fresh food, being able to borrow money increases the money available to buy food or the existence of adequate road infrastructure may lead to decreased food prices. These direct effects all lead to a common intermediate effect, which is better ability of households to acquire healthy and nutritious food. The acquisition of healthy food is dependent on there being food available. Being able to acquire healthy food makes it easier for households to make healthy food choices, which in turn influences their intake of healthy and safe food. This represents the interaction across the different dimensions of food security. When the intermediate effects across all dimensions of food security are in place \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that is, when nutritious food is commonly available in sufficient quantities at fair prices \u00e2\u0080\u0093 households are able to acquire healthy food, all individuals within the household can eat healthy food that meets their nutritional requirements as well as their preferences, and long\u00e2\u0080\u0090term outcomes of food and nutrition security, and thus of improved nutritional status of everyone in the household and in the community, are achievable. INTRO: One potentially harmful unintended consequence of interventions that improve access to food is the increased risk of overweight or obesity (Cotta 2013; Ruel 2013), particularly if there is increased intake of energy\u00e2\u0080\u0090dense ultraprocessed products and sugar\u00e2\u0080\u0090sweetened beverages (Lignani 2011). People may choose to acquire these foods because of lower cost; lack of knowledge about healthy diets; or other social, cultural or individual preferences (Ruel 2013). INTRO: Although we are assessing interventions addressing access to food, it is important to note that, in order to have long\u00e2\u0080\u0090term food and nutrition security, all three dimensions need to be in place: food needs to be available; people need to be able to access it; and they also need to know how to choose the food, prepare and store it appropriately (Pinstrup\u00e2\u0080\u0090Andersen 2009; WHO 2013). INTRO: Why it is important to do this review INTRO: Although many interventions are being implemented to address food insecurity globally, the lack of sufficient improvements in levels of undernutrition over time, particularly in LMICs, highlights the need for the effectiveness of these interventions to be assessed. Furthermore, our scoping review highlighted that existing reviews addressing access to food in LMICs were not of high methodological quality. Therefore, we aimed to apply rigorous Cochrane Review methods to produce a high\u00e2\u0080\u0090quality review to identify effective interventions addressing food access. This evidence would then inform relevant stakeholders' decisions about which interventions to implement in order to achieve desirable results and ensure that scarce resources are utilised efficiently. Furthermore, improving access to food would help improve overall food security and the health and nutritional status of populations, which are requisites for the socioeconomic development of individuals and societies (FAO 2003). INTRO: Objectives INTRO: Primary objective INTRO: To determine the effects of community\u00e2\u0080\u0090level interventions that aim to improve access to nutritious food in LMICs, for both the whole community and for disadvantaged or at\u00e2\u0080\u0090risk individuals or groups within a community, such as infants, children and women; elderly, poor or unemployed people; or minority groups. INTRO: Secondary objectives INTRO: To determine the features of community\u00e2\u0080\u0090level interventions that enable or impair the effective implementation of these interventions to improve access to food. INTRO: To identify unintended consequences of interventions to improve access to food. METHODS: Methods METHODS: Criteria for considering studies for this review METHODS: Types of studies METHODS: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster randomised controlled trials (cRCTs). We also included non\u00e2\u0080\u0090randomised studies because: 1. we did not expect to find many RCTs that would answer our question; and 2. to increase the external validity of the review findings. In these studies, observations are made before and after an intervention has been implemented or an exposure has occurred, both in an intervention and a control group. These types of studies are sometimes referred to as prospective analytical cohort studies or controlled before\u00e2\u0080\u0090after studies. We collectively termed them prospective controlled studies (PCS). We planned to include interrupted time series (ITS), but found none. ITS studies observe the effects of an intervention at multiple time points before and after an intervention. ITS studies needed to have at least three time points both before and after the intervention in order to be included. METHODS: Types of participants METHODS: We included all population groups living in communities in LMICs exposed to community\u00e2\u0080\u0090level interventions aiming to improve food access. For the purpose of this review, we defined a community as a group of people with diverse characteristics who are linked by social ties, share common perspectives and engage in joint action in geographical locations or settings (MacQueen 2001). We included both adults and children living in those communities, as well as disadvantaged groups within those communities. LMICs were defined according to the World Bank 2020. METHODS: Most interventions addressing food insecurity are usually implemented in areas and among populations at high risk for food insecurity, such as low\u00e2\u0080\u0090income areas, unemployed people, women and children. We did not restrict studies on the basis of social and demographic characteristics, and reported these characteristics in the review. METHODS: We excluded studies which only included participants with specific diseases or conditions (e.g. severely malnourished children) as these types of participants require specialised approaches to address malnutrition caused by these diseases or conditions. METHODS: Types of interventions METHODS: We included community\u00e2\u0080\u0090level interventions that aim to improve access to food, as detailed in our logic model (Figure 1). Community\u00e2\u0080\u0090level interventions were defined as those in which the community was the setting where the intervention was implemented, with every member of that community potentially benefiting from it (McLeroy 2003). This includes interventions that are district\u00e2\u0080\u0090, city\u00e2\u0080\u0090 or village\u00e2\u0080\u0090wide or interventions that take place within community institutions such as schools, neighbourhoods, churches or work sites. The intervention may involve individuals, households, organisations or public policy. Based on the literature in this field, and on the findings of our scoping review, we decided to include the following interventions that address access to food (Table 8): TABLE: Definition of interventions included in the review TABLE: Category of intervention\tDefinition\tTypes of interventions\t \tImprove buying power\tInterventions that generate/increase/maintain income to ensure economic access to food and other basic needs.\tCash transfers (conditional or unconditional)Other income generation interventions, e.g.Cash\u00e2\u0080\u0090for\u00e2\u0080\u0090work programmesMicrocredit/microenterprise development \u00e2\u0080\u0093 facilitation of small business development through credit\u00e2\u0080\u0090provision and training in specific business skillsEmployment generating activities, that will generate/increase incomeAgriculture\u00e2\u0080\u0090related interventions \u00e2\u0080\u0093 training /cash cropping/livestock ownership/other. These interventions are only included if they aim to increase income of households. Agricultural interventions only aiming to increase/ensure enough food for consumption are excluded.\t \tFood prices\tInterventions that reduce price of food and thus increase economic access to food.\tFood stamps or vouchers (distribution of coupons or stamps that can be used to purchase foods in local markets, etc.)Food subsidies/discountsPolicies/regulations that reduce/regulate food prices\t \tInfrastructure/transport\tInterventions that ensure people/communities have physical access to food/food outlets.\tRural infrastructure development; e.g. roads that enable access to shops/ marketsInterventions that ensure affordable transportation to markets/food outletsAdequate food storage facilities\t \tSocial environment/support\tInterventions that ensure people have social support/support network they can resort to for money/food in times of need, or access to adequate storage facilities (e.g. shared fridge) or services (e.g. transport/childcare) \u00e2\u0080\u0093 leading to increased economic or physical access to foodSocial support can be instrumental, emotional, informational, or companionship. We were interested in instrumental social support, i.e. practical help that can be accessed in times of need.\tChildcare so parents can go to workBorrowing money/food from neighbours/relativesCommunity fund/village savings loansShared fridge/storage facilitiesShared transport METHODS: interventions that improve buying power (e.g. income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation opportunities, cash transfer schemes); METHODS: interventions addressing food prices (e.g. policies, discounts, vouchers and subsidies); METHODS: interventions addressing infrastructure and transport that affect physical access to food outlets; METHODS: interventions addressing the social environment and social support (e.g. social support from family, neighbours or government). METHODS: We included studies that compared these interventions, individually or in combination, to no intervention or to other eligible interventions, including treatment as usual. METHODS: We chose this broad approach because we did not expect to find many eligible studies to include for each of the intervention types. METHODS: As we anticipated variability in the duration of included interventions, we included interventions of any duration. METHODS: Although we were interested in interventions that have measured access to nutritious food, we did not apply this as an inclusion criterion. Instead, we captured this information when extracting the details of included interventions, if this was available. METHODS: We excluded interventions that addressed transient food insecurity (e.g. food aid during natural disasters and wars) and that provided short\u00e2\u0080\u0090term relief from food insecurity (e.g. one\u00e2\u0080\u0090off food voucher, food banks or soup kitchens). We also excluded interventions that provided food in the form of food baskets or in\u00e2\u0080\u0090kind transfers of food. These types of interventions, according to our logic model, fall under the groups of interventions addressing availability and were, therefore, excluded. Other types of in\u00e2\u0080\u0090kind transfers (e.g. livestock, food vouchers, etc), that were not directly providing food to participants but contributed to their economic access to food, were eligible for inclusion. Interventions that involved agricultural production also typically fall under 'food availability', however, if their aim was specifically to generate income, they were included. METHODS: Types of outcome measures METHODS: Given the complex nature of food security, we assessed outcomes at different levels, namely at the community, household and individual levels. METHODS: The findings of our scoping review showed that the types of outcomes measured across food security interventions vary considerably. For this reason, we took a broad approach regarding the outcomes to include. METHODS: Given that our main interest was in determining whether these interventions improve access to food and, consequently, food security and nutritional status, we included only interventions that had measured outcomes related to food access or nutritional status, or that used a food security measurement tool. We included any study that had at least one of the outcomes listed below. METHODS: Primary outcomes METHODS: Our primary outcomes included those that measure access to food at the household and community level. Following from our logic model, these were the following changes in the (FAO 2013; Smith 2006): METHODS: prevalence of undernourishment (i.e. proportion of people with insufficient intake to meet minimum dietary energy requirements (MDER) (); METHODS: proportion of household expenditure on food (as proportion of household income or of total household expenditure); METHODS: proportion of households who were food secure (e.g. according to various measures or indices of food security and dietary diversity at an individual or household level), as measured in the included study. METHODS: Secondary outcomes METHODS: Secondary outcomes were those that reflect access to food and food availability and utilisation. Thus, they reflect nutritional status, which is the ultimate goal of food security interventions at the individual level. Following from our logic model, the secondary outcomes at the individual level were: METHODS: change in adequacy of dietary intake (e.g. food or energy intake and whether it meets energy and nutrient requirements; if intake was not assessed for adequacy, i.e. only calories reported, this was not reported in the review); METHODS: change in anthropometric indicators (e.g. stunting, wasting and underweight in children, according to height, weight, height\u00e2\u0080\u0090for\u00e2\u0080\u0090age z\u00e2\u0080\u0090scores (HAZ), weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090for\u00e2\u0080\u0090height z\u00e2\u0080\u0090scores (WHZ), and weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090for\u00e2\u0080\u0090age z\u00e2\u0080\u0090scores (WAZ); underweight and overweight in adults according to body mass index (BMI) classifications); METHODS: change in biochemical indicators (e.g. micronutrient levels in the blood); METHODS: cognitive function and development during the intervention period (e.g. Denver Developmental Screening Test, Bayley Scales of Infant Development); METHODS: change in proportion of anxiety or depression (as described by the included study's authors); METHODS: morbidity (as described by the review authors); METHODS: adverse outcomes (e.g. proportion overweight or obese as a potentially harmful consequence of these type of interventions). METHODS: We only included outcomes that were measured at least three months after the intervention was implemented as outcomes measured earlier are not likely to reflect sustainable changes. METHODS: Search methods for identification of studies METHODS: Electronic searches METHODS: We searched electronic databases from 1980 onwards for relevant studies. We applied no language or publication status limits. We chose the year 1980 as the starting point because it was around this time that the term 'food security', encompassing access to food, started being used (Masset 2011). The initial searches were conducted in September 2016 in the following databases: METHODS: Ovid MEDLINE(R) Epub Ahead of Print 11 July 2016, Ovid MEDLINE 1946 to June week 5 2016, Ovid MEDLINE(R) In\u00e2\u0080\u0090Process & Other Non\u00e2\u0080\u0090Indexed Citations 11 July 2016, Ovid MEDLINE Daily Update 11 July 2016; METHODS: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL): Issue 6, 2016 (the Cochrane Library/Wiley); METHODS: Embase (Elsevier); METHODS: GreenFILE (EBSCO); METHODS: AfricaBib (africabib.org); METHODS: AGRIS; METHODS: AGRICOLA; METHODS: AFRICAN HEALTHLINE, African Journals Online (via Africa\u00e2\u0080\u0090Wide Information, EBSCO); METHODS: Trials Register of Promoting Health Interventions (TRoPHI); METHODS: WHO Global Index Medicus; METHODS: Web of Science (Conference Proceedings Citation Index, Science Citation Index Expanded, Social Science Citation Index); METHODS: Sociological Abstracts (ProQuest); METHODS: International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS) (ProQuest); METHODS: Global Health (EBSCO); METHODS: ClinicalTrials.gov; METHODS: WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. METHODS: A combination of text words and controlled vocabulary terms related to the interventions and possible outcome measures were used to develop a sensitive search strategy. The search strategies for the different databases are available in Appendix 1, which is an adaptation of the search strategy for the Cochrane Review assessing interventions to improve food security in developed countries (Burns 2010). We applied a study design filter to the search that has been developed by Joy Oliver, the information specialist at Cochrane South Africa. The original search strategy for MEDLINE published with the protocol of this review had to be revised by a librarian and adapted for Ovid MEDLINE, as it retrieved an excessive number of results. The Ovid MEDLINE search strategy was then modified to be adapted for the other databases and reported as appendices in our full review. We recruited the Cochrane Public Health Group's information specialist to advise on and implement the search strategy. METHODS: The search was updated in April 2019 and February 2020. For the updates, we followed the recommendations of Garner 2016. The Cochrane Public Health Group's information specialist defined a minimum set of databases that would have identified the original included studies and optimised the remaining database searches to improve the balance of sensitivity and precision of the search strategies. We searched the following databases from 1980 onwards: METHODS: Ovid MEDLINE(R) and Epub Ahead of Print, In\u00e2\u0080\u0090Process & Other Non\u00e2\u0080\u0090Indexed Citations, Daily and Versions; METHODS: CENTRAL (the Cochrane Library/Wiley); METHODS: Web of Science (Conference Proceedings Citation Index, Science Citation Index Expanded, Social Science Citation Index); METHODS: Global Health (EBSCO); METHODS: Sociological Abstracts (ProQuest); METHODS: International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. METHODS: The search strategies for each database included in the latest search, which is the same as for the April 2019 search, are available in Appendix 1. Appendix 2 presents the search strategies of the original search strategy in September 2016. METHODS: Some of the electronic databases specified above index a combination of published and unpublished studies, such as doctoral thesis and conference abstracts. Therefore, the electronic searches captured some of the unpublished studies. For further searching for unpublished studies, see Searching other resources. METHODS: Searching other resources METHODS: We identified additional studies through searching reference lists of similar reviews or contacting authors of included studies. However, much of the additional searches we were planning to undertake at the protocol stage were not carried out. We provide reasons in the Differences between protocol and review section. METHODS: Data collection and analysis METHODS: Selection of studies METHODS: Two author pairs (SD, AS, MV, AB, JO, VR, BS) independently screened all titles and abstracts retrieved to determine eligibility against the inclusion criteria. Full\u00e2\u0080\u0090text copies of eligible titles and of those for which eligibility was unclear were retrieved for closer examination. Any disagreements regarding eligibility were resolved through discussion or through arbitration by a third author, if necessary. We recorded the reasons for excluding studies at the full\u00e2\u0080\u0090text screening stage in the Characteristics of excluded studies table. We completed a PRISMA flow chart of study selection. METHODS: The initial title and abstract screening, from the first search, was carried out using Word documents. The full\u00e2\u0080\u0090text screening and all subsequent screening was carried out using the Covidence platform. METHODS: Where we found relevant studies in a language other than English, Portuguese or Spanish, we planned to contact Cochrane Public Health for options for translations. We found studies in French, which a colleague reviewed against the eligibility criteria. As these were not eligible for inclusion, no translations were required. We found no studies in any other language that required translation. METHODS: We used EndNote X8 to manage the retrieved records and to remove duplicate reports of the same study. The study was considered the unit and all references related to the same study were grouped under the same identifier. METHODS: Data extraction and management METHODS: For each included study, author pairs (SD, AS, MV, AB, JO, VR, BS) extracted data independently and resolved disagreements through discussion or arbitration by a third author. We collected all data except those concerning outcomes using Covidence, using a standardised data collection form, which was piloted on two studies. One author extracted outcomes data using a standardised and piloted form in Microsoft Excel 2007 and a second author (a biostatistician; YB) checked all the data extracted. We based our data extraction form on the forms from Cochrane Public Health and Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC), modified to suit our review. We extracted the following data. METHODS: Study design and methods (recruitment of participants, representativeness of sample, number of intervention groups, randomisation procedure, statistical methods). METHODS: Details about the participants, including PROGRESS\u00e2\u0080\u0090Plus characteristics and number in each group at baseline and at the endpoint. PROGRESS\u00e2\u0080\u0090Plus characteristics refer to characteristics of participants that can be used to identify disadvantaged groups and that allow us to differentiate the effects of the intervention across social categories (Tugwell 2010). These characteristics include: place of residence, race or ethnicity, occupation, gender, religion, education, socioeconomic status and social capital; and Plus characteristics include age). We extracted details about withdrawals and dropouts, if these were available. METHODS: Details about the intervention, including process measures (e.g. aims; social and cultural context; comparison interventions; length of the intervention; duration of follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up; implementation factors such as amount of conditional cash transfers, number of times transport is given or total amount of food vouchers given to each individual), and whether the intervention was universal or targeted. This information aimed to provide insight on the factors that may impair or facilitate implementation of the intervention, which addresses the second objective of this review. We also extracted information on whether the intervention aimed to improve access to nutritious food, how nutritious food was defined, if specific nutritious foods were targeted for increased access and what types of food were accessed by participants. METHODS: Description of outcomes used to measure effectiveness and how they were measured. METHODS: Primary outcomes at the household and community level. METHODS: Secondary outcomes at the individual level. METHODS: Other process measures including intervention cost and sustainability. METHODS: Source of study funding and sponsorship of the interventions. METHODS: We incorporated the Cochrane\u00e2\u0080\u0090Campbell Methods Group Equity Checklist into our data extraction form (); however, the included studies reported very little of this information. METHODS: We extracted information on potential confounders or moderators of the study outcomes. These included sociodemographic variables such as gender, ethnicity or race, and place of residence, and other PROGRESS\u00e2\u0080\u0090Plus characteristics based on the details available in the studies. METHODS: When necessary, we contacted the authors of primary studies to for clarification or to seek missing information. METHODS: We used Review Manager 2014 for data management and analysis. METHODS: Assessment of risk of bias in included studies METHODS: Author pairs (SD, AS, MV, AB, JO, VR, BS) conducted the risk of bias assessment and resolved disagreements through discussion or arbitration by a third author. Risk of bias assessments were also carried out in Covidence. METHODS: We assessed the risk of bias for all RCTs and PCS using the EPOC risk of bias tool for studies with a separate control group (EPOC 2017). This tool assesses the same risk of bias domains as the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool for RCTs (Higgins 2011), namely sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessors, incomplete outcome data (including loss of clusters in the case of cRCTs), selective outcome reporting and other bias. It also includes additional domains to assess the risk of bias from inappropriate methods regarding: similarity of baseline outcome measurements, similarity of baseline characteristics and whether the study was protected against contamination. For other bias, we specifically assessed misclassification bias of the exposure, measurement bias and two domains related to cRCTs: incorrect analysis (i.e. whether the study adjusted for clustering) and recruitment bias. We assessed the risk of bias from lack of blinding of participants and personnel and of outcome assessors separately. We had planned to assess the risk of bias from lack of blinding separately for objective and subjective outcomes and to assess the risk of bias from incomplete outcome data separately for different outcomes. However, given the disparity and multiplicity of outcomes reported, we decided not to do this. However, we did consider whether the outcome was objective or subjective when assessing the risk of bias from lack of blinding. METHODS: We had planned to use the EPOC risk of bias tool for ITS study designs; however, we included no ITS studies. METHODS: For each item, we made a judgement of 'High risk', 'Unclear risk', or 'Low risk', with supportive information to justify these judgements provided in the Characteristics of included studies table. We incorporated the risk of bias assessment in the interpretation of our review findings, and we did not restrict analysis by degree of risk of bias. We presented a 'Risk of bias' graph and a summary figure. METHODS: To assess overall risk of bias at study level, we considered its risk of bias for two key domains: selection and attrition bias. For example, if a study was classified at high risk of either selection or attrition bias, it was classified as having overall high risk of bias. METHODS: Measures of treatment effect METHODS: Where data allowed, we conducted meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis using Review Manager 5 (Review Manager 2014). However, due to sparsely reported data, we were unable to conduct a meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis in many instances. METHODS: For binary outcomes, we planned to report the risk ratio (RR) of outcomes in the intervention group compared to the control group. Only one included study reported the RR as an overall effect measure for the intervention. The other 28 included studies that reported dichotomous outcomes reported the change in proportion using percentage points (pp) (68%) or using reported odds ratios (OR) (32%). METHODS: For continuous outcomes, and where baseline data were available, we reported the mean difference (MD) between the change in the intervention and control groups if the outcomes had been measured in the same way by all studies. If the continuous outcomes were measured in distinct ways in different studies in a comparison, we used the standardised mean difference (SMD) between the intervention and control groups. Where the change per group was not available, we used end values where randomisation was successful. If there was a reasonable risk of selection bias, and the change per group was not available, the study was not included in a meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis. METHODS: The included studies reported mostly estimates from regression or from difference\u00e2\u0080\u0090in\u00e2\u0080\u0090difference analyses, which were interpretable as an MD and thus were reported as such. None of the studies reported the effects per group, and in most cases the data were only available either for baseline or endline, and if it was available, often there was no measure of variance reported. Thus, we described the effect measures as reported in the included studies. METHODS: We reported 95% confidence intervals (CIs) alongside all effect estimates, when these were available or when it was possible to calculate them. Calculations of 95% CI were done in Review Manager (using the inverse variance option; Review Manager 2014) or using a Microsoft Excel 2007 spreadsheet with the formula to calculate the 95% CI from the regression estimate and standard error (SE) value. We report P values only where no 95% CI was reported or could be calculated to illustrate the strength of evidence for the effect size. METHODS: Unit of analysis issues METHODS: cRCTs that randomise groups rather than individuals to intervention groups and that report analyses at the individual level needed to also report the method used to account for clustering. A biostatistician (YB) checked all studies to ensure that the clustering effect had been accounted for correctly. If they had not taken the clustering effect into account in their analyses, we would have requested individual participant data, calculated an intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC), and re\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysed the data appropriately. If we had been unable to obtain primary data, we would have attempted to find an appropriate ICC from the literature and adjust the sample size accordingly. We had planned to meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analyse the effect estimates and SEs from cRCTs using generic inverse\u00e2\u0080\u0090variance methods in Review Manager 2014. If we had re\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysed the data, we would have clearly marked the results as re\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysed and we would have stated where re\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis had not been possible. However, we did not have to re\u00e2\u0080\u0090analyse the data for included cRCTs as they all correctly accounted for clustering. METHODS: In cases where the outcomes were measured at multiple time points, we had planned to group the outcomes measured at similar time points where this was possible. For any particular outcome, if most studies were reporting a specific time point and only one study reported multiple time points, we reported the most commonly reported time point. In most cases, the time points were similar and, for the few instances where this was not the case, we extracted measures from all time points but reported the latest time point. Taking into account that the minimum duration after implementation at which we extracted outcomes was three months, the short\u00e2\u0080\u0090term time point was three to six months. METHODS: We only considered outcomes reported immediately at the end of the intervention, not postintervention follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up. METHODS: In many cases, studies reported multiple outcome measures for the same outcome domains. To prioritise the outcomes, we selected the measure that provided the largest scale measure of the domain (i.e. the most comprehensive outcome). For example, in cases where individual and composite measures for the same outcome domain were reported for the same study, we preferentially reported composite measures as these are probably more useful to decision\u00e2\u0080\u0090makers. For anthropometry, we did not report effects on weight and height units, but rather reported z\u00e2\u0080\u0090scores for weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090for\u00e2\u0080\u0090age and height\u00e2\u0080\u0090for\u00e2\u0080\u0090age, in which weight and height are assessed against a reference standard. All outcomes reported in a study are presented in the Characteristics of included studies table, as well as an indication of which were selected for synthesis. METHODS: For interventions with multiple comparison groups, all groups that met this review's inclusion criteria were included. If there were more than two relevant comparison groups for the same intervention, we attempted to combine the relevant experimental and control groups to make a single pairwise comparison. This was the case in three studies, for which two interventions groups were combined. If this was not possible, we made multiple pairwise comparisons between the relevant groups and divided the sample size of the shared intervention group evenly across the comparisons to avoid double counting of participants in a meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis. If a meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis was not possible and we could not combine the results of different groups, we presented the results of all relevant groups. METHODS: Dealing with missing data METHODS: If there were unclear or missing data related to study methodology, participants lost to follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up, outcome data or statistics, we contacted the study's primary author via email. We recorded all communications with authors in Appendix 3. METHODS: We recorded all missing outcome data in the data extraction form and in the Characteristics of included studies table. If it was not possible to obtain missing outcome information after attempting to do so, we would have excluded these studies from the meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis. We did not exclude any studies due to missing outcome data. METHODS: Five included studies did not report the number analysed for at least one outcome (for which the number (n) is stated as not reported (NR)) (Ahmed 2019a; Ahmed 2019b; Andaleeb 2016; Ferre 2014; Hoddinott 2013). This lack of reporting reduces our confidence in the estimated treatment effect as we are unable to assess if the study was powered to detect an effect, analysed accounting for any clustering or if attrition bias was likely. In addition, it has been shown that trial sample sizes can influence treatment effect, with smaller studies reporting larger effect estimates (Dechartres 2013). With no sample sizes reported, it is difficult to ascertain whether this bias exists. METHODS: Assessment of heterogeneity METHODS: Where we were able to meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analyse, we assessed heterogeneity, or the variability among the studies included in a meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis, by visual inspection of overlap of CIs, and by assessing statistical heterogeneity with the Chi2 statistic (P < 0.1) (Deeks 2019). We calculated the I2 statistic to quantify heterogeneity; with an I2 statistic of 75% and above indicating substantial heterogeneity. We also calculated Tau2, which reflects the extent of variation among intervention effects in different studies, to assess heterogeneity (Deeks 2019). However, in most cases, we were unable to carry out meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analyses or create forest plots due to heterogeneity. Instead, we assessed clinical, methodological and conceptual heterogeneity, through tabulation of characteristics of studies included in the same synthesis. For specific comparisons and outcomes, we assessed clinical or conceptual heterogeneity by considering variability in the participants and interventions, or co\u00e2\u0080\u0090interventions, including study duration, intervention dosing and outcome assessment. We assessed methodological heterogeneity by considering the variability in study design and risk of bias (Deeks 2019; Singh 2017). METHODS: Assessment of reporting biases METHODS: We had planned to assess the likelihood of reporting bias through funnel plots for each outcome with 10 or more included studies in a meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis (Sterne 2019). We would have assessed the funnel plots visually for sources of asymmetry, such as small\u00e2\u0080\u0090study effects, publication bias or other. If it was likely that asymmetry was caused by small\u00e2\u0080\u0090study effects, we would have conducted sensitivity analysis to explore how this affected the results and conclusions of the meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis. However, we were unable to do this as none of the compared outcomes were assessed by at least 10 studies. METHODS: Data synthesis METHODS: In most cases, we were unable to include all studies reporting a specific outcome domain in a meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis. This was due to studies reporting multiple measures for the same domain that could not be combined, either because there was missing information regarding variance measures, or because the effect measures reported could not be converted to a standardised metric. Therefore, we synthesised the data from all studies reporting on the same outcome domain using vote counting based on the effect direction method (McKenzie 2019). The results of individual studies were presented in one of four categories: 1. 'favours control' if the point estimate favoured the control and the 95% CI did not cross the null; 2. 'unclear effect; potentially favouring the control' if the point estimate favoured the control but the 95% CI crossed the null; 3. 'unclear effect; potentially favouring the intervention' if the point estimate favoured the intervention and the 95% CI crossed the null; and 4. 'favours intervention' if the point estimate favoured the intervention and the 95% CI did not cross the null. Where no CI was provided or could be calculated, we decided whether the effects were 'clear' or 'unclear' based on provided P values. However, P values did not inform the effect direction reported. Although this is a useful method to synthesise data when meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis is not possible, there are some limitations associated with this method, for example, it does not provide information on the magnitude of effects, does not account for differences in the relative sizes of the studies and is a less powerful method than that used to combine P values (McKenzie 2019). METHODS: Regarding the effect direction synthesis, we reported the number of studies with results in the different effect categories for each outcome domain, and the probability of observing this based on the multinomial distribution (for outcome domains with two or more studies and assuming the true proportion is 0.25 for all categories). This information was reported in the first paragraph reporting results for a specific outcome in the effects of interventions section. If a meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis of all studies in the outcome domain was possible, the multinomial distribution P value was not reported. To visually display the results for key outcomes included in the 'Summary of findings' tables, we created harvest plots for each comparison. These harvest plots depict data both from RCTs and from PCS for key summary of findings outcomes. We presented the results of the effect direction synthesis separately for RCTs and for PCS, in the Effects of interventions section. METHODS: In some instances, we were able to carry out a meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis, either for all studies reporting on the same outcome measure (n = 35), or for a subset of studies that could be combined in a meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis (n = 8). We conducted meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analyses in Review Manager 2014 if the included studies were sufficiently homogeneous (I2 < 75%) and if there was a minimum of two studies for any type of intervention being compared reporting the same outcome measure. Not pooling results in cases of high heterogeneity is an accepted approach in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Deeks 2019). We also explored heterogeneity and reported this when there was high heterogeneity. We did not have sufficient data to carry out any subgroup analysis or meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090regression to more formally explore heterogeneity. We carried out meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analyses separately for each outcome and type of study design, and we used the random\u00e2\u0080\u0090effects model for all analyses to account for any existing heterogeneity. We generated forest plots for each comparison and outcome where meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analyses could be carried out (see Data and analyses). METHODS: In preparation for synthesis, we first grouped all studies assessing the same intervention categories to identify which studies could be grouped under each preplanned comparison, and no changes to prespecified grouping were required. The comparison groups were based on the pre\u00e2\u0080\u0090specified types of interventions listed in table 2: cash transfers (unconditional; conditional), income generation interventions, food vouchers, food subsidies, and social support interventions. Under each comparison, we tabulated the available data and time frames reported for each outcome, which helped identify what data were available, and thus where meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis was possible and where we had to synthesise using effect direction. A meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis was possible if the effect and variance estimates were available for all studies or could be calculated from the available data, and if all effect estimates were of the same type (e.g. OR or MD) or could be converted for the comparison (e.g. OR to SMD). Where necessary, we converted OR to SMD, MD to SMD, or MD to SMD to OR. METHODS: We prepared two additional types of tables to aid visualisation of available data. One was the 'Overview of included studies' table, summarising main characteristics and reported outcomes of included studies for each comparison (McKenzie 2019). In this table, we organised studies first by study design, with RCTs first followed by PCS, and second according to their overall risk of bias (low, unclear and then high risk of bias). The second type were tables with the results for individual studies, for each comparison, for scrutiny by the reader. The studies in these tables were also ordered according to their overall risk of bias. METHODS: We had planned to assess and discuss the implementation factors common to effective interventions, if this information was reported in included studies or in published process evaluations that are mentioned in the study report. However, there was insufficient information from included studies on this. METHODS: Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity METHODS: We did not have enough data per outcome and comparison to carry out subgroup analyses. If data allowed, we would have conducted subgroup analysis to assess effectiveness for people at different levels of disadvantage. In updates of this review, we will include the following subgroups. METHODS: Geographic location (e.g. urban versus rural, country or region). METHODS: Sex (male versus female). METHODS: Age (e.g. elderly people, adults, children, infants). METHODS: Baseline nutritional status (e.g. underweight, overweight, micronutrient deficiencies). METHODS: We would also have assessed important implementation factors through subgroups analyses, including the following. METHODS: Intensity of intervention (high intensity versus low intensity, e.g. in relation to amount of food vouchers or of conditional cash transfers). METHODS: Length of study and follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up (e.g. three to six months, more than six months to less than two years, and two years and beyond). METHODS: Whether the intervention specifically aimed to improve access to nutritious food. METHODS: These analyses would have allowed further exploration of heterogeneity. In order to compare the different subgroups with each other, we would have conducted a standard heterogeneity test in Review Manager 2014 across the subgroup results, by calculating the I2 statistic. We would have made sure that the subgroup data being compared were independent. METHODS: Sensitivity analysis METHODS: We conducted a sensitivity analysis to assess risk of bias for outcomes with five or more studies. Studies with overall low risk of bias were included in the sensitivity analysis. We reported the results of study designs separately. METHODS: Summary of findings and assessment of the certainty of the evidence METHODS: The 'Summary of findings' tables include information regarding the number of participants and studies for key outcomes, a summary of the intervention effect and a measure of the certainty of evidence for each outcome according to GRADE considerations. GRADE is a system of rating certainty of evidence in systematic reviews (Guyatt 2010). We rated the overall certainty of evidence for a particular outcome on\u00e2\u0080\u0090line with GRADEpro as high, moderate, low or very low. All RCTs started at high\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence and the following factors were considered to downgrade the certainty: overall risk of bias, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias. All PCS started at low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence and the following factors would have been considered to upgrade the certainty: large magnitude of effect, dose\u00e2\u0080\u0090response gradient and effect of plausible residual confounding. We did not upgrade the certainty of evidence for PCS as there were existing reasons for downgrading (Sch\u00c3\u00bcnemann 2019). As most of the evidence was not from pooled data, we used the 'Summary of findings' table format for narrative synthesis. METHODS: We had planned to include a 'Summary of findings' table for the primary outcomes of this review. However, we decided to also include some of the secondary outcomes. The choice of outcome categories and specific outcome measures to report in the 'Summary of findings' table were decided by the review author team through in\u00e2\u0080\u0090depth discussion until consensus was reached, taking into consideration which outcomes would be useful to decision\u00e2\u0080\u0090makers. The 'Summary of findings' tables included the following outcomes. METHODS: Prevalence of undernourishment. METHODS: Proportion of household expenditure on food. METHODS: Proportion of households who were food secure. METHODS: Dietary diversity. METHODS: Stunting. METHODS: Wasting. METHODS: Cognitive function and development. METHODS: Three authors met to rate the evidence per outcome for each of the 'Summary of findings' tables. Decisions about whether to downgrade or not were made through discussion and reaching consensus. Evidence on different outcomes was available from different study designs. Where there was evidence for a particular outcome from both RCTs and PCS, we reported the data from the RCTs in the 'Summary of findings' table. When there were no data from RCTs for a particular outcome, we reported data from PCS that reported that outcome. We reported the certainty of the evidence in the Effects of interventions for outcomes which assessed with GRADE. For other outcomes, we report the risk of bias, as an indicator of the certainty of the evidence to consider when interpreting the findings. RESULTS: Results RESULTS: Description of studies RESULTS: Results of the search RESULTS: We screened titles and abstracts of 15,477 deduplicated records identified through searching electronic databases and reference searching of eligible studies. Of these, we assessed the full texts of 463 records against the eligibility criteria. After assessing available full\u00e2\u0080\u0090texts, we included 59 studies reported in 116 records in this review. Some interventions were reported in more than one study, and two records each reported on two different studies. Of the remaining records: we placed 39 studies under awaiting classification as we could not access them or they were conference abstracts, 11 studies are still ongoing and we excluded 297 records with reasons. In the Characteristics of excluded studies table, we report a subset of key excluded studies. The study selection process is described in Figure 2. FIG: Study flow diagram. RESULTS: Included studies RESULTS: We included 59 studies in this review (Table 9). In this section we provide a summary overview of included studies. More details are provided in the results of interventions section, for studies included in each comparison, and in the Characteristics of included studies table.

Huerta 2006 (PROGRESA) is a nested study of the PROGRESA cluster\u00e2\u0080\u0090RCT (Gertler 2000 (PROGRESA)). RESULTS: It is important to note that three studies, of different design, evaluated the same programme: PROGRESA (Gertler 2000 (PROGRESA); Huerta 2006 (PROGRESA); Leroy 2008 (PROGRESA)) (Table 10). In addition, two studies assessed the effects of a programme in Malawi in different study settings (Miller 2011; Brugh 2018), whereas two studies reported the effects of an income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation intervention during different periods (Alaofe 2016; Alaofe 2019).

In reality, control communities started receiving the intervention in late 1999, about 1.5 years after the intervention communities.Timepoints of data collection (through household surveys \u00e2\u0080\u0093 ENCEL):March 1998 (pre\u00e2\u0080\u0090intervention)October/November 1998May/June 1999October/November 1999September/December 2003 (follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up)September/December 2007 (follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up)\t'Oportunidades' (previously called Progresa) is a conditional cash transfer programme implemented by the Mexican government since April 1998.Women in eligible households receive cash transfers every 2 months (a food and an education transfer) if they adhered to specific conditionalities: all family members attend preventive health services regularly; children aged 0\u00e2\u0080\u00935 years and lactating mothers attended nutrition monitoring clinics for growth monitoring, immunisation, to obtain nutrition supplements, and for nutrition and hygiene education; pregnant women attend antenatal care, receive nutritional supplements and health education.The education transfers included scholarships for school attendance and school supplies, and was dependent on children's school attendance.The value of the transfers was about 20\u00e2\u0080\u009330% to the household consumption expenditure preintervention.\t506/50,000 eligible rural villages were randomly selected based on the index level of community poverty. Of these, 320 communities were allocated to the intervention group and 186 to the control group. Within each community, households were selected by proxy means testing and selection validated in a community assembly.Some studies assessed outcomes in a subsample of the study population.Fernald 2008 followed up on a sample of children in 2003: children aged 24\u00e2\u0080\u009372 months in the 'Early intervention' group (from 144 communities), and children aged 2\u00e2\u0080\u00935 years in the 'Late intervention' group (from 108 communities).Fernald 2009, followed up a sample of children in 2007: 1093 children aged 8\u00e2\u0080\u009310 years in the 'Early intervention' group, and 700 children aged 9\u00e2\u0080\u009310 years in the 'Late intervention' group.\tHousehold food consumption (Hoddinott 2000)Dietary diversity (Hoddinott 2000)Total caloric availability (Hoddinott 2000; 2003a)Morbidity (children aged 0\u00e2\u0080\u00935 years) (Gertler 2004)Fernald 2008 and Fernald 2009 only assessed data that included the period when both the control and intervention groups were receiving the intervention (i.e. early vs late intervention).

RESULTS: All studies had a control group. Most studies compared the intervention with a control group where there was no intervention implemented, six studies compared the intervention with another food security\u00e2\u0080\u0090related intervention (Andaleeb 2016; Chakrabarti 2018; Gangopadhyay 2015; Hoddinott 2013; Renzaho 2017; Schwab 2013), and one study compared the intervention with another intervention unrelated to food security (Weinhardt 2017). Four studies had three intervention groups (Chen 2019;Gangopadhyay 2015;Ponce 2017; Verbowski 2018 ), four studies had four intervention groups (Brunie 2014; Fenn 2015; Hidrobo 2014; Skoufias 2013), and two studies had five intervention arms (Ahmed 2019a; Ahmed 2019b). In all but three cases the study groups were either not relevant for the review or they pertained to different comparisons, therefore, there were no issues with overlapping control groups. For three studies with two relevant intervention arms, these were combined. In some studies, the control group received the intervention at a later stage; this review only captured data for the period during which the control group was not yet receiving the intervention. RESULTS: The unit of allocation or exposure to the intervention was at group level in 41 studies (including communities, electoral divisions, municipalities, parishes, districts, villages, other), at household level in 14 studies (Alaofe 2016; Andersen 2015; Asadullah 2015; Gangopadhyay 2015; Haushofer 2013; Huerta 2006 (PROGRESA); Jensen 2011; Jodlowski 2016; Kennedy 1989; Kurdi 2019; Leroy 2008 (PROGRESA); Macours 2012; Porter 2016; Sturm 2013), and individual level in four studies (including individuals, women, and children) (Aguero 2006; Baird 2013; Katz 2001; Murshed E Jahan 2011). RESULTS: The sample size in included studies ranged from 214 to 169,485 participants and 300 to 124,644 households. All studies collected data on individual participants except for Sturm 2013, which collected supermarket sales data. RESULTS: Maximum follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up was three months in one study (Hoddinott 2013), greater than three months to 12 months in 10 studies (Alaofe 2016; Alaofe 2019; Chen 2019; Fenn 2015; Gangopadhyay 2015; Hidrobo 2014; Jensen 2011; Miller 2011; Ponce 2017; Schwab 2013), greater than 12 months to two years in 25 studies, greater than two years to five years in 17 studies (Asfaw 2014; Baird 2013; Beegle 2017; Breisinger 2018; Brunie 2014; Chakrabarti 2018; Doocy 2017; Evans 2014;Hjelm 2017; Kurdi 2019; Lopez Arana 2016; Macours 2012; Murshed E Jahan 2011; Osei 2017; Sturm 2013; Tonguet Papucci 2015; Weinhardt 2017), and greater than five years to nine years in six studies (Aguero 2006; Andaleeb 2016; Andersen 2015; Asadullah 2015; Porter 2016; Renzaho 2017).

Under the income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation category, each individual study assessed different types of interventions, including agricultural programmes, livestock transfer programmes or community\u00e2\u0080\u0090based programmes) (Table 11).

RESULTS: Eight studies assessed interventions addressing food prices: four RCTs evaluated the effects of food vouchers (Fenn 2015; Hidrobo 2014; Jensen 2011; Ponce 2017); one cRCT (Chen 2019) and three PCS (Sturm 2013; Andaleeb 2016; Chakrabarti 2018) evaluated the effects of food and nutrition subsidies. RESULTS: Two studies assessed social environment interventions: one cRCT (Kusuma 2017b) and one PCS (Brunie 2014) evaluated an intervention addressing the social environment, namely the effects of village savings and loans (VSL) and community grants. RESULTS: Some studies assessed more than one type or category of intervention. Hidrobo 2014 and Fenn 2015 included a group for a CCT and another for food vouchers. Baird 2013 included two groups for conditional and unconditional cash transfers. Porter 2016 assessed a public works intervention providing either cash or food for work, or an UCT. RESULTS: Participants RESULTS: Twenty\u00e2\u0080\u0090five studies included children or households in which children lived. Of these, five studies included households with children under 18 months of age (Andersen 2015; Fernald 2011; Marquis 2018; Olney 2016; Tonguet Papucci 2015); 10 studies included households with children under six years of age (Ahmed 2019a; Ahmed 2019b; Alaofe 2019; Daidone 2014; Fenn 2015; Kennedy 1989; Kurdi 2019; Osei 2017; Renzaho 2017; Verbowski 2018), and six with children under 18 years of age (Chen 2019; Kandpal 2016; Kusuma 2017b; Kusuma 2017a; Lopez Arana 2016; Pellerano 2014); three included households with children, without specifying their age (Aguero 2006; Asfaw 2014; Huerta 2006 (PROGRESA)). Baird 2013 included girls 13 to 22 years of age who had never married. RESULTS: Five studies included adults; in one study, these were members of a healthcare plan (Sturm 2013), one included farmers (Murshed E Jahan 2011), one include men and women (Doocy 2017), and three studies included only women and their respective households (Alaofe 2016; Alaofe 2019; Katz 2001). RESULTS: Twenty\u00e2\u0080\u0090nine studies included households without specifying the inclusion of children (Andaleeb 2016; Asadullah 2015; Beegle 2017; Breisinger 2018; Brugh 2018; Brunie 2014; Chakrabarti 2018; Darrouzet Nardi 2016; Evans 2014; Ferre 2014; Gangopadhyay 2015; Gertler 2000 (PROGRESA); Haushofer 2013; Hidrobo 2014; Hjelm 2017; Hoddinott 2013; Jensen 2011; Jodlowski 2016; Kangmennaang 2017; Leroy 2008 (PROGRESA); Macours 2012; Maluccio 2005; Merttens 2013; Miller 2011; Ponce 2017; Porter 2016; Schwab 2013; Skoufias 2013; Weinhardt 2017). RESULTS: We extracted information from included studies on the following PROGRESS\u00e2\u0080\u0090Plus characteristics: age, place of residence, sex, ethnicity and language, occupation, education, socioeconomic status and social capital, where this was available. There was considerable variation in the reporting of these characteristics. Most studies (48/59) reported on an aspect of socioeconomic status, with 38 studies on age, 37 on sex, 34 on place of residence, 32 on education, 17 on ethnicity and language, 16 studies on occupation and 13 studies on social capital. RESULTS: Setting and context RESULTS: Most included studies were conducted in Africa (27): one each in Egypt (Breisinger 2018), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (Doocy 2017), Ghana (Marquis 2018), Ethiopia (Porter 2016), Lesotho (Pellerano 2014), Mozambique (Brunie 2014), Niger (Hoddinott 2013), and Tanzania (Evans 2014); two each in Benin (Alaofe 2016; Alaofe 2019), Burkina Faso (Olney 2016; Tonguet Papucci 2015), and South Africa (Aguero 2006; Sturm 2013); three in Zambia (Daidone 2014; Jodlowski 2016; Hjelm 2017); four in Kenya (Asfaw 2014; Haushofer 2013; Kennedy 1989; Merttens 2013); six in Malawi (Baird 2013; Beegle 2017; Brugh 2018; Kangmennaang 2017; Miller 2011; Weinhardt 2017). RESULTS: Nineteen included studies were conducted in Asia: five in Bangladesh (Ahmed 2019a; Ahmed 2019b; Asadullah 2015; Ferre 2014; Murshed E Jahan 2011); four in Nepal (Darrouzet Nardi 2016; Katz 2001; Osei 2017; Renzaho 2017); three in India (Andaleeb 2016; Chakrabarti 2018; Gangopadhyay 2015) and two in China (Jensen 2011; Chen 2019), Indonesia (Kusuma 2017b; Kusuma 2017a); and one each in Cambodia (Verbowski 2018), Pakistan (Fenn 2015), and Philippines (Kandpal 2016). RESULTS: Five included studies were conducted in South America: one each in Colombia (Lopez Arana 2016) and Peru (Andersen 2015), and three in Ecuador (Fernald 2011; Hidrobo 2014; Ponce 2017). RESULTS: Two studies were conducted in Nicaragua, Central America (Macours 2012; Maluccio 2005), and four studies took place in Mexico, North America (Gertler 2000 (PROGRESA); Huerta 2006 (PROGRESA); Leroy 2008 (PROGRESA); Skoufias 2013). Two studies were conducted in Yemen, Middle East (Kurdi 2019; Schwab 2013). RESULTS: All studies specifically targeted poor communities or households except two; one that included data from supermarkets in urban areas in South Africa (Sturm 2013), and one that targeted children enrolled in elementary schools in rural China (Chen 2019). Of those targeting communities, 24 studies did not specify the type of communities, 29 included rural communities, including farming communities, and four included urban communities. RESULTS: Outcome measures RESULTS: No included study assessed the primary outcome, namely the prevalence of undernourishment (i.e. people with insufficient food intake to meet their dietary requirements). RESULTS: Eleven studies reported household expenditure on food (Alaofe 2016; Asfaw 2014; Brugh 2018; Ferre 2014; Hjelm 2017; Kennedy 1989; Macours 2012; Maluccio 2005; Merttens 2013; Miller 2011; Sturm 2013). Household expenditure was reported using different units, for example, household food expenditure per day, week or month; or as a proportion of total weekly or monthly household expenditure. One of these studies reported sales data, including the ratio of expenditure on healthy foods, on fruits and vegetables and on less desirable foods, compared to the total food expenditure (Sturm 2013). RESULTS: Food security was reported as food security indices and\u00c2\u00a0dietary diversity measures. Thirteen studies reported food security outcomes using measures such as the proportion of participants experiencing food security or food deficit always, of households consuming more than one meal per day, Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS) and Food Security Index (FSI) (Asadullah 2015; Beegle 2017; Brugh 2018; Brunie 2014; Daidone 2014; Doocy 2017; Haushofer 2013; Hjelm 2017; Kangmennaang 2017; Miller 2011; Osei 2017; Pellerano 2014; Weinhardt 2017). Twenty\u00e2\u0080\u0090four studies reported on dietary diversity using a variety of measures including individual and Household Dietary Diversity Scores (HDDS), Food Consumption Scores (FCS), minimum dietary diversity (MDD) or minimum acceptable food consumption (Ahmed 2019a; Ahmed 2019b; Alaofe 2019; Asfaw 2014; Beegle 2017; Breisinger 2018; Brugh 2018; Brunie 2014; Chen 2019; Daidone 2014; Darrouzet Nardi 2016; Doocy 2017; Ferre 2014; Hidrobo 2014; Jodlowski 2016; Kurdi 2019; Marquis 2018; Merttens 2013; Miller 2011; Olney 2016; Pellerano 2014; Ponce 2017; Skoufias 2013; Tonguet Papucci 2015).

RESULTS: Six studies reported adequacy of dietary intake (Ahmed 2019a; Ahmed 2019b; Andaleeb 2016; Brugh 2018; Jensen 2011; Kennedy 1989). Measures reported included the proportion of calorie\u00e2\u0080\u0090deficient households and of preschool children meeting caloric requirements; mineral and vitamin sufficiency indices; calorie\u00e2\u0080\u0090deficient households; and ratio of caloric, protein and fat intake to the dietary recommendations. Many studies reported intake in terms of calories or nutrients consumed without relating it to a measure of adequacy; these measures were not reported in this review. RESULTS: A variety of anthropometric measures were reported in included studies. Twenty\u00e2\u0080\u0090seven studies reported on measures of stunting in children (i.e. chronic undernutrition), such as the proportion stunted (HAZ < \u00e2\u0080\u00932 standard deviations (SD)), severely stunted (HAZ < \u00e2\u0080\u00933SD) or mean HAZ (Aguero 2006; Ahmed 2019a; Ahmed 2019b; Andersen 2015; Asfaw 2014; Daidone 2014; Darrouzet Nardi 2016; Doocy 2017; Evans 2014; Fenn 2015; Fernald 2011; Ferre 2014; Kandpal 2016; Kennedy 1989; Kurdi 2019; Kusuma 2017b; Kusuma 2017a; Leroy 2008 (PROGRESA); Lopez Arana 2016; Macours 2012; Maluccio 2005; Marquis 2018; Merttens 2013; Osei 2017; Renzaho 2017; Tonguet Papucci 2015; Verbowski 2018). Twenty studies reported on measures of wasting in children (i.e. acute undernutrition), such the proportion wasted (WHZ < \u00e2\u0080\u00932SD), severely wasted (WHZ < \u00e2\u0080\u00933SD) or mean WHZ (Ahmed 2019a; Ahmed 2019b; Asfaw 2014; Daidone 2014; Evans 2014; Fenn 2015; Ferre 2014; Kennedy 1989; Kurdi 2019; Kusuma 2017b; Kusuma 2017a; Leroy 2008 (PROGRESA); Lopez Arana 2016; Maluccio 2005; Marquis 2018; Merttens 2013; Osei 2017; Renzaho 2017; Tonguet Papucci 2015; Verbowski 2018).

RESULTS: Six studies reported biochemical outcomes, including haemoglobin in five studies (Chen 2019; Fenn 2015; Fernald 2011; Osei 2017; Verbowski 2018) and vitamin A and iron deficiency in one study (Alaofe 2019). RESULTS: Five studies reported cognitive function and development outcomes using a variety of measures including Ravens Colored Matrixes and other cognitive tests, Early Childhood Development Index, individual cognitive function measures such as language and memory, and grade attainment (Andersen 2015; Baird 2013; Daidone 2014; Fernald 2011; Macours 2012).

RESULTS: Seventeen studies reported morbidity outcomes (Ahmed 2019a; Ahmed 2019b; Alaofe 2019; Asadullah 2015; Chen 2019; Daidone 2014; Evans 2014; Fenn 2015; Gertler 2000 (PROGRESA); Kandpal 2016; Kennedy 1989; Macours 2012; Merttens 2013; Osei 2017; Pellerano 2014; Tonguet Papucci 2015; Verbowski 2018). Various measures of morbidity were reported including incidence of respiratory infections, diarrhoea and anaemia; the proportion of participants who were ill in a specified reference period or the number of days or percent of time ill. RESULTS: No studies reported specific adverse events. We had specified that overweight and obesity would be considered adverse events in this review, and three studies reported this outcome in young and older children (Andersen 2015; Lopez Arana 2016; Pellerano 2014); however, not as adverse events per se. RESULTS: Funding and conflicts of Interest RESULTS: Most included studies were funded either by non\u00e2\u0080\u0090profit organisations (including research institutes, world bank, non\u00e2\u0080\u0090government organisations, etc) or governmental/intergovernmental agencies (or both) except for one study that was funded by a for\u00e2\u0080\u0090profit organisation (Elanco Animal Health; Jodlowski 2016). One study did not disclose their funding (Gangopadhyay 2015). RESULTS: Of 59 included studies, 39 did not report on potential conflicts of interest (COI) and 27 did. Of those that reported their COI, all declared that none of the authors had any potential COI. RESULTS: Excluded studies RESULTS: We excluded 297 studies. Of the excluded studies: 152 had an ineligible study design, seven did not have an eligible population or setting, 89 did not address an eligible intervention, 23 did not report on relevant outcomes and 26 were duplicates. A selection of 85 key excluded studies is reported in the Characteristics of excluded studies table. RESULTS: Studies awaiting classification RESULTS: We placed 39 studies awaiting classification because we could not assess their eligibility properly without access to the full text, or they were conference abstracts with insufficient data to include them in the review (see Characteristics of studies awaiting classification table). RESULTS: Ongoing studies RESULTS: We identified two studies that could potentially be included in the review once completed. Eleven studies were identified as ongoing. More details on these studies are available in the Characteristics of ongoing studies table. RESULTS: Risk of bias in included studies RESULTS: See the Characteristics of included studies table for more details for each domain of bias assessed for each study. Figure 3 presents a summary of the judgements per risk of bias items and Figure 4 presents the summary of the risk of bias judgments for each included study. FIG: Risk of bias graph: review authors' judgements about each risk of bias item presented as percentages across all included studies. FIG: Risk of bias summary: review authors' judgements about each risk of bias item for each included study. RESULTS: Allocation RESULTS: Risk of selection bias is determined by whether participants were randomly allocated to the intervention groups (random sequence generation) and whether there was no possibility of altering the sequence while allocating participants to the intervention groups (allocation concealment). RESULTS: Of the 36 included RCTs, 14 studies described adequate methods of random sequence generation and were at low risk of selection bias. Five studies described doing this using computer\u00e2\u0080\u0090generated random numbers (Baird 2013; Beegle 2017; Fenn 2015; Marquis 2018; Verbowski 2018), one each used STATA software (Gertler 2000 (PROGRESA)) and a randomisation algorithm (Skoufias 2013), while the remaining seven studies randomised communities through public lottery events (Brugh 2018; Daidone 2014; Macours 2012; Maluccio 2005; Merttens 2013; Pellerano 2014; Tonguet Papucci 2015). Twenty\u00e2\u0080\u0090two studies reported randomising individuals or clusters to intervention groups, but did not report how the random sequence had been generated and thus were at unclear risk of selection bias (Ahmed 2019a; Ahmed 2019b; Asfaw 2014; Chen 2019; Darrouzet Nardi 2016; Evans 2014; Fernald 2011; Gangopadhyay 2015; Haushofer 2013; Hidrobo 2014; Hjelm 2017; Hoddinott 2013; Jensen 2011; Kandpal 2016; Kurdi 2019; Kusuma 2017b; Kusuma 2017a; Miller 2011; Olney 2016; Osei 2017; Ponce 2017; Schwab 2013). RESULTS: Of the 36 included RCTs, 20 reported that allocation was at the cluster level (communities, parishes, electoral divisions, etc.) and carried out at the beginning of the study, and these were classified at low risk of selection bias (Ahmed 2019a; Ahmed 2019b; Baird 2013; Beegle 2017; Brugh 2018; Chen 2019; Daidone 2014; Fenn 2015; Fernald 2011; Gertler 2000 (PROGRESA); Macours 2012; Maluccio 2005; Marquis 2018; Merttens 2013; Olney 2016; Osei 2017; Pellerano 2014; Schwab 2013; Skoufias 2013; Tonguet Papucci 2015). Three studies did not conceal allocation or report this, but household selection was done after villages had been allocated to each intervention group, and knowledge of allocation could have influenced the household selection process (Evans 2014; Hidrobo 2014; Kurdi 2019). In Gangopadhyay 2015, participants self\u00e2\u0080\u0090selected into the intervention. These four studies were at high risk of selection bias. The remaining 12 studies did not report details on allocation concealment and were at unclear risk of selection bias (Asfaw 2014; Darrouzet Nardi 2016; Haushofer 2013; Hjelm 2017; Hoddinott 2013; Jensen 2011; Kandpal 2016; Kusuma 2017b; Kusuma 2017a; Miller 2011; Ponce 2017; Verbowski 2018). RESULTS: All 23 PCS were at high risk of selection bias (both for random sequence and allocation concealment), according to EPOC's risk of bias tool guidance (EPOC 2017). RESULTS: Baseline similarity in participants characteristics and outcome measures (selection bias) RESULTS: Baseline imbalances in participant characteristics or outcome measures may occur in non\u00e2\u0080\u0090randomised studies as well as in randomised studies in which the allocation procedure was not performed adequately. RESULTS: Participants characteristics RESULTS: In 46 included studies, there were no baseline imbalances reported for participant characteristics or, if there were, these were adjusted for in the analyses, and thus they were at low risk of selection bias (Figure 4). Four studies had significant differences at baseline that were not adjusted for in the analyses; thus they were at high risk of selection bias (Asadullah 2015; Beegle 2017; Kurdi 2019; Merttens 2013). Ten studies were at unclear risk of selection bias: six did not report any or some baseline characteristics (Aguero 2006; Breisinger 2018; Murshed E Jahan 2011; Ponce 2017; Porter 2016; Sturm 2013), one reported baseline characteristics but not whether these were balanced (Gangopadhyay 2015), one reported that characteristics were balanced at household level but not at province level (Jensen 2011), one reported discrepancies and it was unclear whether these were adjusted for in the analysis (Schwab 2013), and one only had baseline data for the group analysed, not for the entire sample (Chen 2019). RESULTS: Outcome measures RESULTS: Thirty\u00e2\u0080\u0090one studies either were balanced at baseline with regards to outcome measures, or adjusted for any imbalance in the analyses, and were at low risk of selection bias (Figure 4). In seven studies there were significant baseline imbalances in relevant outcomes which were not controlled for in the analyses, and these were at high risk of selection bias (Andersen 2015; Asadullah 2015; Beegle 2017; Breisinger 2018; Merttens 2013; Renzaho 2017; Sturm 2013). The remaining 21 studies were classified at unclear risk of selection bias: 15 did not report any or relevant outcomes at baseline (Aguero 2006; Baird 2013; Chen 2019; Darrouzet Nardi 2016; Evans 2014; Gertler 2000 (PROGRESA); Hjelm 2017; Huerta 2006 (PROGRESA); Kandpal 2016; Kurdi 2019; Kusuma 2017b; Kusuma 2017a; Murshed E Jahan 2011; Porter 2016; Verbowski 2018); in three, the baseline data collection occurred after the intervention started, so true baseline data were not available (Hoddinott 2013; Lopez Arana 2016; Schwab 2013), in two studies it was unclear if reported imbalances were adjusted for (Doocy 2017; Osei 2017), and in one, although the outcomes were balanced at household level, there were imbalances at province level (Jensen 2011). RESULTS: Blinding RESULTS: Blinding participants and personnel to intervention allocation during the study helps prevent systematic differences in how participants are treated or behave during the trial due to knowledge of treatment allocation (performance bias). In the types of studies included in this review, blinding of participants and personnel was often not feasible; however, it is also unlikely that it would have influenced the behaviour of participants or personnel beyond that expected as part of the intervention, and thus less likely to be susceptible to performance bias. Thus, in all but one study included in this review, the risk of performance bias was low. One study was at high risk of performance bias as blinding was not possible and the delivery of the intervention, a nutrition subsidy to schools, was dependent on the school principal (Chen 2019). RESULTS: Blinding of outcome assessors helps prevent systematic differences in how outcomes are assessed in either intervention groups due to knowledge of treatment allocation (detection bias). Fifteen studies were at low risk of detection bias; in 14 of these studies, blinding was not done; however, the outcomes measured and reported were objective and thus unlikely to have been influenced by knowledge of treatment allocation (Aguero 2006; Ahmed 2019a; Ahmed 2019b; Andersen 2015; Fernald 2011; Kusuma 2017b; Kusuma 2017a; Leroy 2008 (PROGRESA); Lopez Arana 2016; Marquis 2018; Osei 2017; Porter 2016; Renzaho 2017; Skoufias 2013). The other study was based on scanner sales data from supermarkets, which is not susceptible to detection bias due to lack of blinding (Sturm 2013). The remaining 44 studies were at high risk of detection bias either because there was no blinding or they included self\u00e2\u0080\u0090reported or subjective outcomes that were susceptible to be influenced by knowledge of treatment allocation. RESULTS: Protection against contamination (performance bias) RESULTS: If the control group is exposed to the intervention intended for the intervention group, contamination occurs, introducing performance bias. RESULTS: Thirty\u00e2\u0080\u0090seven studies were at low risk of bias in this domain either because they reported evidence of no contamination, or because the intervention and control groups were allocated at the community/village/district level (i.e. in distinct geographical areas), which precludes contamination. Eight studies were at high risk of bias as they reported evidence of control group exposure to the intervention (Asfaw 2014; Doocy 2017; Ferre 2014; Huerta 2006 (PROGRESA); Jodlowski 2016; Kandpal 2016; Katz 2001; Kurdi 2019). The remaining 14 studies were at unclear risk (Aguero 2006; Andersen 2015; Asadullah 2015; Brunie 2014; Daidone 2014; Gertler 2000 (PROGRESA); Kangmennaang 2017; Lopez Arana 2016; Maluccio 2005; Murshed E Jahan 2011;Osei 2017; Ponce 2017; Porter 2016; Skoufias 2013). In these studies, the location or the distance between intervention and control communities was unclear, or the control and intervention households were in same community and there was potential for control households to have benefited from the intervention through interaction with intervention households (e.g. sharing), or communities were geographically near/adjacent. RESULTS: Incomplete outcome data RESULTS: Twenty\u00e2\u0080\u0090five studies were at low risk of bias because they had low attrition (i.e. 10% or less) or because attrition between the groups was non\u00e2\u0080\u0090differential or unrelated to the outcome. Seventeen studies were at high risk of attrition bias, because of high levels of attrition or they reported differential attrition between intervention groups or characteristics of those lost to follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up were different from those remaining in the study, or a combination of these (Andaleeb 2016; Asadullah 2015; Asfaw 2014; Chen 2019; Doocy 2017; Huerta 2006 (PROGRESA); Kandpal 2016; Kangmennaang 2017; Katz 2001; Kurdi Leroy 2008 (PROGRESA); Lopez Arana 2016; Merttens 2013; Ponce 2017; Schwab 2013; Skoufias 2013; Weinhardt 2017). Skoufias 2013 reported only a 5% difference in attrition between groups but lost one entire cluster and participants were excluded from the analysis were different than those included in the analysis, thus was classified at high risk. Seventeen studies were classified at unclear risk of attrition bias, as they either did not report attrition at all or did not report enough information to make this judgement (Aguero 2006; Alaofe 2016; Alaofe 2019; Beegle 2017; Brunie 2014; Chakrabarti 2018; Darrouzet Nardi 2016; Fernald 2011; Ferre 2014; Gertler 2000 (PROGRESA); Hjelm 2017; Kennedy 1989; Olney 2016; Osei 2017; Porter 2016; Sturm 2013; Verbowski 2018). Sturm 2013 analysed supermarket sales scanner data and did not report if any of these data were excluded or missing. RESULTS: Selective reporting RESULTS: Selective outcome reporting occurs when authors do not report on all outcomes prespecified and assessed in the study. Six studies were at low risk of bias, as they reported the same outcomes that were prespecified in the trial registry (Baird 2013; Fenn 2015; Haushofer 2013; Olney 2016; Verbowski 2018; Weinhardt 2017). RESULTS: One study was at high risk of bias because some of the morbidity outcomes (oedema and measles) reported in protocol were not reported in the published paper (Tonguet Papucci 2015). RESULTS: The remaining 52 studies were at unclear risk of bias as there were no protocols available. RESULTS: Other potential sources of bias RESULTS: Under other potential sources of bias we considered whether the study could have been influenced by 1. misclassification bias of the exposure (i.e. when exposure to the intervention was self\u00e2\u0080\u0090reported); 2. measurement bias (i.e. whether outcomes were measured appropriately; 3. incorrect analysis, in the case of cRCTs (i.e. whether study data were adjusted for clustering. Such analyses do not lead to biased estimates of effect but in the meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis such studies receive undue weight leading to overprecision of the effect estimate); and 4. recruitment bias, in the case of cRCTs (i.e. whether recruitment of participants was done before allocation of clusters to intervention groups). RESULTS: Twenty\u00e2\u0080\u0090two studies were at low risk as no other potential sources of bias were identified. Six studies were at high risk of bias as at least one other potential source of bias was identified (Alaofe 2019; Asfaw 2014; Gertler 2000 (PROGRESA); Huerta 2006 (PROGRESA); Osei 2017; Schwab 2013). Asfaw 2014 was at high risk for misclassification bias as receipt of the intervention was based on self\u00e2\u0080\u0090report. Three were at high risk of recruitment bias as clusters were assigned before households were recruited (Asfaw 2014; Gertler 2000 (PROGRESA); Osei 2017). Two studies were at high risk of measurement bias: in Huerta 2006 (PROGRESA) preliminary analyses showed evidence of reporting error regarding health outcomes, and in Alaofe 2019 dietary data were collected with only one 24\u00e2\u0080\u0090hour recall. Schwab 2013 was at high risk of other bias due to the different timing of implementation of interventions in each group. The remaining 31 studies were at unclear risk of other bias; in these studies there was at least one of the other potential sources of bias for which there was insufficient information to make a judgement. RESULTS: Effects of interventions RESULTS: See: Table 1; Table 2; Table 3; Table 4; Table 5; Table 6 RESULTS: We present the effects of interventions on primary and secondary outcomes separately for each category of intervention as outlined below (see Table 8 for definitions of intervention categories and types). RESULTS: Interventions that improved buying power: RESULTS: Unconditional cash transfers RESULTS: Conditional cash transfers RESULTS: Income generation interventions RESULTS: Interventions that addressed food prices: RESULTS: Food prices \u00e2\u0080\u0093 food vouchers RESULTS: Food prices \u00e2\u0080\u0093 food and nutrition subsidies RESULTS: Interventions that addressed the social environment RESULTS: Social support interventions (community grants/savings schemes) RESULTS: We found no studies addressing the intervention category of infrastructure changes, which we had intended to include in the review. RESULTS: The 'Summary of findings' tables provide an overview of effects on all primary outcomes and key secondary outcomes, for each comparison. RESULTS: Comparison 1: unconditional cash transfers RESULTS: Twenty\u00e2\u0080\u0090one included studies assessed UCTs, where a specific amount of money was transferred to poor families monthly or once every two months, with no conditions regarding behaviours expected from the families. Fourteen cRCTs (Ahmed 2019a; Ahmed 2019b; Asfaw 2014; Baird 2013; Brugh 2018; Daidone 2014; Fenn 2015; Fernald 2011; Hjelm 2017; Merttens 2013; Miller 2011; Pellerano 2014; Skoufias 2013; Tonguet Papucci 2015), two RCTs (Gangopadhyay 2015; Haushofer 2013), and three PCS (Aguero 2006; Breisinger 2018; Renzaho 2017) assessed the effects of UCTs versus no intervention. Two cRCTs assessed UCTs versus food transfers (Hoddinott 2013; Schwab 2013). RESULTS: Five cRCTs reported on the proportion of household expenditure on food (Asfaw 2014; Brugh 2018; Hjelm 2017; Merttens 2013; Miller 2011). Five cRCTs (Brugh 2018; Daidone 2014; Hjelm 2017; Miller 2011; Pellerano 2014) and one RCT (Haushofer 2013) reported on various food security measures, and 10 cRCTs reported on various dietary diversity measures (Ahmed 2019a; Ahmed 2019b; Asfaw 2014; Brugh 2018; Daidone 2014; Merttens 2013; Miller 2011; Pellerano 2014; Skoufias 2013; Tonguet Papucci 2015). Eight cRCTs (Asfaw 2014; Daidone 2014; Fernald 2011; Merttens 2013; Pellerano 2014; Tonguet Papucci 2015; Fenn 2015; Ahmed 2019a; Ahmed 2019b), and one PCS (Aguero 2006) reported various anthropometric measures. Two clusters RCT reported and biochemical indicators (Fernald 2011; Fenn 2015), and three cRCTs reported on cognitive function and development outcomes (Baird 2013; Daidone 2014; Fernald 2011). Three cRCTs (Baird 2013; Fernald 2011; Hjelm 2017) and one RCT (Haushofer 2013) reported on measures of mental well\u00e2\u0080\u0090being. Seven cRCTs reported measures of morbidity (Ahmed 2019a; Ahmed 2019b; Daidone 2014; Fenn 2015; Merttens 2013; Pellerano 2014; Tonguet Papucci 2015), and one cRCT reported adverse effects (Pellerano 2014). Hoddinott 2013 and Schwab 2013, the cRCTs where the comparison group was food transfers, reported on measures of dietary diversity, and Schwab 2013 also reported measures of food security. RESULTS: Further details about the studies in this comparison are presented in Table 14. Table 15 presents results of individual trials included and Table 16 presents results of individual PCS included, on all reported outcomes. The Table 1 and the harvest plot in Figure 5 summarise the effects of UCTs on key outcomes.

FIG: Harvest plot: unconditional cash transfers. RESULTS: Primary outcomes RESULTS: 1.1 Change in prevalence of undernourishment RESULTS: None of the included studies measured prevalence of undernourishment. RESULTS: 1.2 Proportion of household expenditure on food RESULTS: As household income increases, the share of household expenditure on food should decrease relative to other household expenditure (INDDEX Project 2018). Five cRCTs reported this outcome (Asfaw 2014; Brugh 2018; Hjelm 2017; Merttens 2013; Miller 2011), with evidence being very uncertain about the effects of UCTs on the proportion of household expenditure on food (5 trials, 11,271 households; very low certainty evidence; Table 1). Effects varied across the five studies, with one study showing a clear effect favouring UCTs, two studies showing an unclear effect potentially favouring UCTs, and two studies show a clear effect favouring the control (P = 0.003; Figure 5). Three of these studies could be included in a forest plot but data could not be pooled due to high heterogeneity (I2 = 92%; Analysis 1.1). Miller 2011 and Brugh 2018 were two different studies assessing the Malawi cash transfer scheme and thus are the same in terms of the characteristics of participants and interventions although Miller 2011 was a pilot study. Hjelm 2017 assessed the Zambia cash transfer programme. These programmes differed in the amount provided by the cash transfer (USD 11 every second month which was fixed versus USD 40 monthly which varied depending on household size and the number of school\u00e2\u0080\u0090aged children). As expected, the effect in Miller was worse than in the other studies. RESULTS: Brugh 2018 reported a clear effect favouring UCTs, with a decrease in the proportion of household expenditure on food by 2 percentage points at 1 year (pp \u00e2\u0080\u00932, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00933.96 to \u00e2\u0080\u00930.4; 3290 households). This study was at low overall risk of bias. RESULTS: Asfaw 2014 and Merttens 2013 reported an unclear effect potentially favouring UCTs, showing a decrease in the proportion of monthly amount spent on food: Merttens 2013 by \u00e2\u0080\u00930.4 pp at one year (2435 participants; P > 0.1) and Asfaw 2014 by \u00e2\u0080\u00930.95 pp at two years (1824 participants; P > 0.1). These studies were both at high overall risk of bias. RESULTS: Miller 2011 and Hjelm 2017 reported a clear effect favouring the control. Miller 2011 reported an increase in the proportion of total weekly expenditures on food by 12 pp in the intervention group compared to the control at one year (P < 0.0001, 752 participants); Hjelm 2017 reported an increase in per capita share of food expenditure of 4.2 pp (95% CI 0.67 to 7.72). Miller 2011 is at low overall risk of bias and Hjelm 2017 at unclear overall risk of bias. RESULTS: 1.3 Proportion of households who were food secure RESULTS: Twelve trials reported on different food security and dietary diversity measures. Food security measures reflect the frequency and severity of food insecurity experienced by households within a specific reference period (e.g. past month), with a higher number usually indicating more food insecurity. Dietary diversity refers to the number of food groups or food items consumed, by households or individuals within a specific reference period (e.g. past 24 hours), with a higher number indicating better dietary diversity. In our analysis, we included composite measures for food security and dietary diversity (e.g. reported scores or indices), in preference to single outcome measures; details of their definitions and interpretations are presented in Table 12. RESULTS: 1.3.1 Food security RESULTS: Five cRCTs and one RCT reported this outcome, with evidence showing that UCTs improve food security (6 trials, 10,251 households and 7604 children; high\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence; Table 1). All six studies showed a clear effect favouring UCTs (P < 0.001; Figure 5). Miller 2011 and Brugh 2018 reported an increase in the proportion of people eating more than one meal per day with the UCTs: Miller 2011 reported an increase of 42 pp at one year follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up (P < 0.0001; 752 participants); Brugh 2018 reported an increase of 11 pp at one year (95% CI 5.12 to 16.9; 3290 households). Data from these studies could not be pooled due to high heterogeneity (I2 = 87%; Analysis 1.2). These two studies assessed cash transfers in Malawi and the characteristics of participants and interventions were the same, but Miller 2011 was a smaller pilot study and was at unclear overall risk of bias whereas Brugh 2018 was at low overall risk of bias. Daidone 2014, Haushofer 2013, and Hjelm 2017 reported food security scores; Hjelm 2017 using the FSI and Daidone 2014 and Haushofer 2013 using a food security scale based on the HFIAS, and for both of these the higher the value the more beneficial. A meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis of these three studies showed a slight improvement in scores (SMD 0.18, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.23; 6209 households; I2 = 0%; Analysis 1.3). Pellerano 2014 reported a decrease in severe food deprivation (FSI > 2) at two years in children aged from birth to five years (\u00e2\u0080\u009316.63 pp; P < 0.05; 2220 children) and in children aged six to 17 years (82116.10 pp; P > 0.1; 5384 children) receiving the UCT compared to children in the control group. Brugh 2018, Daidone 2014, and Pellerano 2014 were at low overall risk of bias, whereas Haushofer 2013, Hjelm 2017, and Miller 2011 were at unclear overall risk of bias. RESULTS: One cRCT at higher overall risk of bias compared food transfers with UCTs (Schwab 2013). They reported on the number of months of the previous six months that households had difficulty satisfying their food needs, with an unclear effect potentially favouring UCTs (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00931.06; P > 0.05; 1983 households). RESULTS: 1.3.2 Dietary diversity RESULTS: Ten cRCTs and one PCS reported dietary diversity measures. RESULTS: Randomised controlled trials RESULTS: Evidence showed that UCTs may increase dietary diversity (10 RCTs; 11,145 households and 3578 children; low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence; Table 1). Five cRCTs reported a clear effect favouring UCTs and five cRCTs reported an unclear effect potentially favouring UCTs (P < 0.001; Figure 5). RESULTS: Ahmed 2019a, Ahmed 2019b, Asfaw 2014, Miller 2011, and Tonguet Papucci 2015 reported clear effects favouring UCTs. Miller reported an increase in the food diversity composite score (scale: 1 to 8) of 2.4 points more with UCTs compared to the control group (95% CI 1.22 to 3.58; 752 households). Ahmed 2019a reported an increase in FCS (scale: 0 to 112) with UCTs at two years of 6.84 points (95% CI 4.64 to 9.03; n NR) and Ahmed 2019b of 2.62 points (95% CI 0.58 to 4.66; n NR). Asfaw 2014 reported a mean dietary diversity score (scale 0 to 8) higher by 0.82 at two years (1824 households; P < 0.01). Tonguet Papucci 2015 reported the odds of achieving MDD, which were approximately three\u00e2\u0080\u0090fold higher in the children from the UCT group (OR 2.95, 95% CI 1.86 to 4.68; n = 322; P < 0.001). Of these studies, Ahmed 2019a, Ahmed 2019b, and Miller 2011 were at unclear overall risk of bias; Asfaw 2014 was at high overall risk of bias and Tonguet Papucci 2015 was at low overall risk of bias. RESULTS: Brugh 2018, Daidone 2014, Merttens 2013, Pellerano 2014, and Skoufias 2013 reported unclear effects potentially favouring UCTs. Four of these cRCTs reported an increase in the mean dietary diversity score at household level (scale: 0 to 12) (Brugh 2018: 0.23 points, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.39 to 0.86; 3290 households; Daidone 2014: 1.43 points; 2298 households; P = NR; Merttens 2013: 0.3 points; 2436 households; P = NR; Pellerano 2014: 0.16; 1486 households; P > 0.1). Skoufias 2013 reported an increase of 10.6 percentage points in the proportion of children in the intervention group achieving MDD, which referred to consuming at least three to six food groups, compared to the control group at two years (pp 10.6, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00936.65 to 27.85; 568 children; P > 0.05). RESULTS: Three studies reporting diet diversity scores had sufficient data for a meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis, but results were not pooled due to high heterogeneity (I2 = 83%; Analysis 1.4) (Asfaw 2014; Brugh 2018; Miller 2011). These studies reported slightly different measures of dietary diversity but, in all cases, a higher value indicated higher dietary diversity. Two studies assessed a cash transfer programme in Malawi and Asfaw 2014 assessed the Kenya cash transfer programme. Both studies in Malawi included ultra\u00e2\u0080\u0090poor households, the one in Kenya included households with orphans and vulnerable children, which may be more vulnerable. Asfaw 2014 was also at high overall risk of bias whereas the others were at unclear and low overall risk of bias. Two studies reporting the proportion of children with MDD could not be pooled due to high heterogeneity (I2 = 94%, Analysis 1.5) (Skoufias 2013; Tonguet Papucci 2015). The interventions in these two studies differed somewhat; Skoufias 2013, which was at high overall risk of bias, made a payment of approximately USD 14 every two months and accompanied by health education sessions that were not compulsory. Tonguet Papucci 2015 assessed seasonal cash payments of USD 17 (from July to November only), with no educational sessions, and payments were made to mothers. The effect was larger for Tonguet Papucci 2015, which was at low overall risk of bias. RESULTS: Two cRCTs compared UCTs with food transfers (Hoddinott 2013; Schwab 2013). Both reported a clear effect on the FCS favouring UCTs (Hoddinott 2013: MD 4.65, 95% CI 2.41 to 6.87, n = NR; Schwab 2013: MD 4.52, 95% CI 6.85 to 2.19; 1581 households). Hoddinott 2013 was at unclear overall risk of bias and Schwab 2013 was at high overall risk of bias. RESULTS: Prospective controlled studies RESULTS: One PCS reported an unclear effect on the HDDS potentially favouring UCTs (0.16, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.07 to 0.39; 6003 households) (Table 15) (Breisinger 2018). This study was at high overall risk of bias. RESULTS: Secondary outcomes RESULTS: 1.4 Change in adequacy of dietary intake RESULTS: Three cRCTs reported change in adequacy of dietary intake (Ahmed 2019a; Ahmed 2019b; Brugh 2018). One study reported a clear effect favouring UCTs and two studies reported an unclear effect potentially favouring UCTs (P = 0.047) (Table 15). RESULTS: Brugh 2018 reported a clear effect favouring the intervention on the proportion of households who were food energy deficient (i.e. where the total household caloric availability was lower than the total household caloric requirement) (pp \u00e2\u0080\u009310, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u009317.8 to \u00e2\u0080\u00932.16; 3290 households). This study was at low overall risk of bias. RESULTS: Ahmed 2019a and Ahmed 2019b reported an unclear effect potentially favouring UCTs. A meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis of these two studies showed that UCTs may make no difference to the proportion of households with food poverty, defined as per capita daily caloric intake below 2122 calories (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00934.64, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00939.34 to 0.06, n = NR). These studies were at low overall risk of bias. RESULTS: 1.5 Change in anthropometric indicators RESULTS: Ten cRCTs (Ahmed 2019a; Ahmed 2019b; Asfaw 2014; Daidone 2014; Fenn 2015; Fernald 2011; Merttens 2013; Pellerano 2014; Skoufias 2013; Tonguet Papucci 2015) and two PCS (Aguero 2006; Renzaho 2017) reported various anthropometric measures. RESULTS: 1.5.1 Stunting: height\u00e2\u0080\u0090for\u00e2\u0080\u0090age z\u00e2\u0080\u0090scores < \u00e2\u0080\u00932SD; chronic undernutrition) RESULTS: Randomised controlled trials RESULTS: Four cRCTs reported on the proportion of children who were stunted (Asfaw 2014; Fenn 2015; Merttens 2013; Tonguet Papucci 2015), with evidence showing that UCTs may reduce stunting (4 trials, 4713 children; low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence; Table 1). One study showed a clear effect favouring UCTs, two studies showed an unclear effect favouring UCTs, and one study showed an unclear effect favouring control (P = 0.047; Figure 5). A meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis of two of these studies showed a reduction in stunting with UCTs (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.84; 2914 children; I2 = 0%; Analysis 1.7) (Fenn 2015; Tonguet Papucci 2015). RESULTS: Fenn 2015 reported a clear effect favouring UCTs, with a reduction in the odds of stunting of 46% at 12 months (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.81; 1664 children). There was a similar effect for the proportion of children who were severely stunted (HAZ < \u00e2\u0080\u00933SD) (Table 15). This study was at low overall risk of bias. RESULTS: Tonguet Papucci 2015 and Asfaw 2014 reported unclear effects potentially favouring UCTs. Tonguet Papucci 2015 reported a reduced likelihood of stunting in the intervention group compared to the control group at 24 months by 27% (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.14; n = 1250; P = 0.17), but the effect ranged from a beneficial effect on the outcome to worsening the outcome. In Asfaw 2014, the intervention reduced the proportion of stunted children by 4.63 pp (P > 0.1). Tonguet Papucci 2015 was at low overall risk of bias whereas Asfaw 2014 was at high overall risk of bias. RESULTS: Merttens 2013 reported an increase in the proportion of stunted children (pp 7.0; 1062 children; P > 0.1) and severely stunted children (pp 1.9; 1062 children; P > 0.1) among those in the UCT group compared to those in the control group. This study was at high overall risk of bias. RESULTS: In addition to the proportion of stunting, six trials reported the effects on mean HAZ (Ahmed 2019a; Ahmed 2019b; Asfaw 2014; Daidone 2014; Fenn 2015; Fernald 2011); and one on mean z\u00e2\u0080\u0090score per month (Tonguet Papucci 2015). A meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis showed an unclear effect of UCTs on HAZ (MD 0.07, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.04 to 0.18; I2 = 56%; Analysis 1.8). A sensitivity analysis performed using only studies at overall low risk of bias showed a clear effect favouring UCTs (MD 0.16, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.29; Appendix 4) (Daidone 2014; Fenn 2015). RESULTS: Prospective controlled studies RESULTS: One PCS reported a clear effect favouring UCTs on stunting at five years (pp \u00e2\u0080\u00935.16, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00939.55 to \u00e2\u0080\u00930.77; 1491 children; Table 15; Figure 5) (Renzaho 2017). RESULTS: Renzaho 2017 and Aguero 2006 also reported on the effect of UCTs on mean HAZ (data not pooled as SE was not available for either study). Renzaho 2017 reported a clear effect favouring UCTs at five years (pp 18, 95% CI 9 to 27; 1491 children). Aguero 2006 reported that after 72 months, the mean z\u00e2\u0080\u0090score was better in children receiving the intervention (\u00e2\u0080\u00930.84) than in those who only received the intervention after they were aged three years (\u00e2\u0080\u00930.91) (566 children) or those who were rejected or were not yet receiving the intervention (\u00e2\u0080\u00931.08) (399 children). Both studies are at high overall risk of bias. RESULTS: Aguero 2006 also reported the effects of the intervention on HAZ for children receiving the child care grant for different periods of the critical nutritional window aged between 0 and 36 months. They found that for children receiving the intervention for less than 20% of this period there was no effect on HAZ. Compared to receiving a 'small dose', they found a significant impact on HAZ for children receiving the intervention during 45% to 80% of the nutrition window (mean change in HAZ 0.15 at 45%, and 0.25 at 80% of nutritional window; data derived from graphs). RESULTS: 1.5.2 Wasting: weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090for\u00e2\u0080\u0090height z\u00e2\u0080\u0090score < \u00e2\u0080\u00932SD (acute undernutrition) RESULTS: Randomised controlled trials RESULTS: Four cRCTs reported\u00c2\u00a0effects of UCTs on wasting (Asfaw 2014; Fenn 2015; Merttens 2013; Tonguet Papucci 2015). Evidence showed that there was uncertainty about whether UCTs reduce wasting (4 trials, 6396 children; very low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence; Table 1). One study showed an unclear effect potentially favouring UCTs and three studies showed an unclear effect potentially favouring the control (P = 0.016; Figure 5). RESULTS: Tonguet Papucci 2015 reported an unclear effect potentially favouring the intervention, observing a 2% decrease in the risk of wasting at two years (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0.92, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.32; 1250 children; P = 0.66). However, this effect ranged from a 36% reduction to a 32% increase in risk. RESULTS: Asfaw 2014, Merttens 2013, and Fenn 2015 reported an unclear effect potentially favouring the control as they observed an increase in the proportion of wasting among children receiving UCTs, but reported a CI that crossed the null. In Fenn 2015, the odds of wasting was 10% higher among children receiving the intervention at one year (OR 1.10, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.71; 1664 children). At two years, the proportion of wasted children was 5.95 pp higher among those in the UCT group in Asfaw 2014 (989 children; P > 0.1) and 4.7 pp in Merttens 2013 (1062 children; P > 0.1). In Merttens 2013, the proportion of children younger than five years who were severely wasted also increased by 3.9 pp (P > 0.1). Both studies are at high overall risk of bias. RESULTS: In addition to the effects on stunting, five cRCTs reported on the effect of UCTs on mean WHZ (Ahmed 2019a; Ahmed 2019b; Asfaw 2014; Daidone 2014; Fenn 2015) and one on mean WHZ/month (Tonguet Papucci 2015). A meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis of data from these studies showed that UCTs made no difference on WHZ (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00930.02, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.10 to 0.06; I2 = 36%; Analysis 1.9). Two of these studies were at unclear overall risk of bias and one at high overall risk of bias. A sensitivity analysis of studies at low overall risk of bias studies changed the direction of effect to unclearly favour UCTs (MD 0.02, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.18 to 0.21; Appendix 4) (Daidone 2014; Fenn 2015). RESULTS: Prospective controlled studies RESULTS: One PCS reported on stunting, with effects clearly favouring UCTs (pp \u00e2\u0080\u00932.84, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00935.58 to \u00e2\u0080\u00930.1; 1491 children) (Figure 5) (Renzaho 2017). This study was at high overall risk of bias. RESULTS: This study also reported on effect of UCTs on mean WHZ, also reporting a clear effect favouring UCTs (MD 0.19, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.03; 1491 children) (Table 16). RESULTS: 1.5.3 Underweight RESULTS: 1.5.3.1 Weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090for\u00e2\u0080\u0090age z\u00e2\u0080\u0090scores < \u00e2\u0080\u00932SD RESULTS: Three cRCTs reported unclear effects of UCTs on the proportion of underweight children (Asfaw 2014; Merttens 2013; Pellerano 2014). Two trials reported unclear effects potentially favouring UCTs and one trial reported unclear effects potentially favouring the control (P = 0.047) (Table 15; Figure 5). RESULTS: The two studies favouring the intervention reported an unclear effect potentially favouring UCTs on underweight (Asfaw 2014; Pellerano 2014). Pellerano 2014 reported a reduction in proportion of children aged from birth to 36 months who were underweight at two years by 3.64 pp when they were aged 12 months (P > 0.05), Asfaw 2014 reported a reduction of 0.62 pp in the proportion of children aged under five years who were underweight (pp \u00e2\u0080\u00930.62; 1491 children; P > 0.1). RESULTS: Merttens 2013 reported an unclear effect favouring the control, as they reported an increase in the proportion of children who were underweight or severely underweight in the UCT group (3.9 pp with UCT versus 3.2 pp with control; 1062 children; P > 0.1). RESULTS: In addition to the effects of UCTs on underweight, two trials also reported on the effects of UCTs on mean WAZ (Asfaw 2014; Daidone 2014). A meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis of these two studies showed that UCTs may have no effect on underweight (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00930.04, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.43, 0.35; 7577 children: I2 = 74%; Analysis 1.10). Daidone 2014 was at low overall risk of bias, whereas Asfaw 2014 was at high overall risk of bias. Daidone 2014 assessed a child grant programme and Asfaw 2014 assessed a cash transfer programme for households with orphans and vulnerable children, where in some districts some conditions, such as school attendance, and penalties were imposed even though the programme was unconditional. RESULTS: 1.5.3.2 Body mass index RESULTS: One cRCT reported unclear effects potentially favouring the control on BMI of mothers at six months (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00930.1, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.36 to 0.16; 1208 mothers; Table 15) (Fenn 2015). RESULTS: 1.5.3.3 Mid\u00e2\u0080\u0090upper arm circumference RESULTS: One cRCT reported unclear effects potentially favouring UCTs on MUAC measures for mothers and children (MD 0.09, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.13 to 0.3; 1208 mothers; MD 0.06, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.02 to 0.15; 1683 children; Table 15) (Fenn 2015). RESULTS: 1.6 Change in biochemical indicators RESULTS: 1.6.1 Haemoglobin concentration RESULTS: Two cRCTs reported on the effects of UCTs on haemoglobin concentration (Fenn 2015; Fernald 2011). A meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis of these two studies showed an unclear effect of UCTs on haemoglobin in children (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00930.06, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.21 to 0.09; 2605 children; Analysis 1.11). Fenn 2015 also reported on the effects in mothers, finding a clear effect favouring the control on haemoglobin in mothers receiving UCTs (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00930.42, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.63 to \u00e2\u0080\u00930.20; 1208 mothers). Both studies were at low overall risk of bias. RESULTS: 1.7 Cognitive function and development RESULTS: Three cRCTs reported different measures of cognitive function and development (Baird 2013; Daidone 2014; Fernald 2011). Evidence showed that UCTs make little or no difference on cognitive function and development (3 cRCTs; 10,813 children; high\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence; Table 1). All three trials reported an unclear effect favouring the intervention (P = 0.016; Figure 5). RESULTS: Baird 2013 reported an increase in the cognitive test score based on a version of Raven's Colored Progressive matrices at two years (MD 0.14 SDs, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.26; 2057 children) and Daidone 2014 reported an increase in the Early Childhood Development score among children receiving UCTs at two years (MD 0.31; 5670 children; P > 0.1) (Table 15). Fernald 2011 reported on scores after two years for language development in young children receiving UCTs, using two different measures: scores for early language skills of children aged 12 to 35 months using the Inventario do Desenvolvemento de Habilidades Comunicativas (IDHC)\u00e2\u0080\u0090B tool (MD 2.43, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00931.01 to 5.86; 1192 children; P > 0.1), and scores for the receptive vocabulary test (Test de Vocabulario en Imagenes Peabody (TVIP)) in children older than 36 months (MD 0.01, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.08 to 0.10; 1894 children; P > 0.1). However, for both of these, the effect ranged from a decrease to an increase in scores. All cognitive measures reported in the included studies are summarised in Table 13. RESULTS: 1.8 Change in proportion of anxiety or depression (mental health indicators) RESULTS: Three cRCTs (Baird 2013; Fernald 2011; Hjelm 2017) and one RCT (Haushofer 2013) reported different measures of mental health. RESULTS: 1.8.1 Depression RESULTS: Fernald 2011, Haushofer 2013, and Hjelm 2017 reported effects of UCTs on depressive symptoms scores using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES\u00e2\u0080\u0090D) (higher scores indicate worse symptoms). The meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis indicated that UCTs do not make a difference in depression scores at two years (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00930.41, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00931.31 to 0.49; 5787 participants; I2 = 36%; Analysis 1.12). Fernald 2011 assessed the effect of the intervention on men and women, Haushofer 2013 on mothers, and Hjelm 2017 on adolescents. Fernald 2011 and Haushofer 2013 were at low overall risk of bias and Hjelm 2017 was at unclear overall risk of bias. RESULTS: 1.8.2 Perceived stress RESULTS: Two cRCTs (Fernald 2011; Hjelm 2017) and one RCT (Haushofer 2013) reported on the effects of UCTs on perceived stress using Cohen's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) (lower values correspond to less stress). A meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis of Haushofer 2013 and Hjelm 2017 indicated that UCTs may reduce perceived stress (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00930.15, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.26 to \u00e2\u0080\u00930.03; n = 3570; I2 = 0%; Analysis 1.13). Fernald 2011 reported an increase in the perceived stress z\u00e2\u0080\u0090score of mothers in the intervention group at two years, both for those in the bottom quartile of baseline expenditure (MD 0.18, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.02 to 0.37; n = 1430; P < 0.1) and for those in the top three quartiles of baseline expenditure at two years (MD 0.05, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.11 to 0.20; P > 0.1). RESULTS: 1.8.3 Psychological distress RESULTS: One cRCT reported on psychological distress, a binary measure of psychological distress, anxiety and depression; social dysfunction; and loss of confidence based on the 12\u00e2\u0080\u0090item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ\u00e2\u0080\u009012) (Baird 2013). Among girls who were attending school and exposed to a UCT compared to girls in the control group, the proportion of psychological distress was smaller by 14.3 pp at one year (95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u009321.0 to \u00e2\u0080\u00937.6), and by 3.8 pp at two years (95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u009313.14 to 5.8; n = 2089; P > 0.1), but the effect at two years was imprecise. RESULTS: 1.9 Morbidity RESULTS: Seven cRCTs reported on different morbidity measures (Ahmed 2019a; Ahmed 2019b; Daidone 2014; Fenn 2015; Merttens 2013; Pellerano 2014; Tonguet Papucci 2015). RESULTS: 1.9.1 Respiratory infections RESULTS: Four cRCTs reported on the effects of UCTs on respiratory infections (Asfaw 2014; Daidone 2014; Fenn 2015; Tonguet Papucci 2015). Two trials reported a clear effect favouring the intervention and two trials reported an unclear effect potentially favouring the intervention (P = 0.023; Table 15). Data could not be pooled. RESULTS: Asfaw 2014 and Tonguet Papucci 2015 reported clear effects favouring UCTs. Tonguet Papucci 2015 reported a 21% reduced incidence of acute respiratory tract infection episodes among children aged from birth to 15 months in the previous seven days, as refereed by mothers (IRR 0.79, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.81; 1250 children; P < 0.001). Asfaw 2014 reported a reduced risk of respiratory infections of 44% among children aged from birth to seven years (957 children; P < 0.05). Asfaw 2014 was at high overall risk of bias whereas Tonguet Papucci 2015 was at low overall risk of bias. RESULTS: Daidone 2014 and Fenn 2015 reported unclear effects potentially favouring UCTs. Daidone 2014 reported that the proportion of children aged from birth to 60 months with acute respiratory tract infection in a two\u00e2\u0080\u0090week reference period was lower by 3.6 pp in the intervention group compared to the control group (effect estimate \u00e2\u0080\u00930.036, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.061 to \u00e2\u0080\u00930.011; P > 0.05). In Fenn 2015, the odds of respiratory infections was 27% lower among children in the UCT group (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.03; 1683 children). Both studies were at low overall risk of bias. RESULTS: 1.9.2 Diarrhoeal disease RESULTS: Five cRCTs reported on the effects of UCTs on diarrhoeal disease (Ahmed 2019a; Ahmed 2019b; Daidone 2014; Fenn 2015; Tonguet Papucci 2015). One study reported a clear effect favouring UCTs, two studies reported an unclear effect potentially favouring UCTs, one study reported an unclear effect potentially favouring the control, and one study reported no effect (P = 0.047) (Table 15). RESULTS: Daidone 2014 reported clear effects favouring UCTs. Among children aged from birth to 60 months in the UCT group, the proportion with diarrhoea in the previous two weeks reduced by 4.9 pp at one year (pp \u00e2\u0080\u00934.9, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00938.9 to \u00e2\u0080\u00930.9; 7232 children; P < 0.05). RESULTS: Ahmed 2019a and Ahmed 2019b reported unclear effects potentially favouring UCTs. In Ahmed 2019a, there was a reduction in the proportion of children with diarrhoea of 0.3 pp (95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.04 to 0.04, n = NR), and in Ahmed 2019b of 0.9 pp (95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.05 to 0.03, n = NR). All studies were at low overall risk of bias. RESULTS: Tonguet Papucci 2015 reported no difference between the groups in the incidence of diarrhoeal episodes in the previous seven days, as reported by the mother, after one year of the intervention (IRR 1.00, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.03; 1250 children; P = 0.89). This study was at low overall risk of bias. RESULTS: 1.9.3 Any illness RESULTS: Two cRCTs reported on the effects of UCTs on the proportion of children or people who were ill (Merttens 2013; Pellerano 2014), one reporting a clear effect favouring UCTs and the other unclear effects favouring the control (P = 0.125) (Table 15). RESULTS: Pellerano 2014 reported a reduction in the proportion of children who were ill in the previous month in the intervention compared to the control group by 15 pp at one year (from 39% to 31%) (pp \u00e2\u0080\u009315,38; 1996 children; P < 0.1). RESULTS: In Merttens 2013, there was no difference between the intervention and control groups in the proportion of people who reported being ill or injured in the previous three months, after one year of the intervention (pp 1.0; 14,342 participants; P > 0.1). In this study, these proportions reduced significantly in both intervention and control groups, and injuries were also included as an 'illness'. Pellerano 2014 was at low overall risk of bias whereas Merttens 2013 was at high overall risk of bias due to high risk of selection and attrition bias. RESULTS: 1.10 Adverse outcomes (proportion of participants overweight or obese) RESULTS: Pellerano 2014, a cRCT, reported unclear effects potentially favouring UCTs on the proportion of infants who were overweight when they were aged six and 12 months, at two years of the intervention (6 months old: pp \u00e2\u0080\u00935.08; 474 children; P > 0.05; 12 months old: pp \u00e2\u0080\u00936.46; 293 children; P > 0.05) (Table 15). RESULTS: Comparison 2: conditional cash transfers RESULTS: Fourteen included studies assessed CCTs, where a specified amount of money was transferred to poor families regularly as long as they meet specific conditions. Nine were cRCTs (Baird 2013; Evans 2014; Gertler 2000 (PROGRESA); Hidrobo 2014; Kandpal 2016; Kurdi 2019; Kusuma 2017a; Macours 2012; Maluccio 2005) and five were PCS (Andersen 2015; Ferre 2014; Huerta 2006 (PROGRESA); Leroy 2008 (PROGRESA); Lopez Arana 2016). All studies compared CCTs with no intervention. However, requirements and other intervention components differed across studies. Requirements (or conditions) included regular check\u00e2\u0080\u0090ups for children, school enrolment and regular attendance, vaccination, micronutrient supplementation for children or for pregnant women, and attending nutrition education sessions. RESULTS: Two cRCTs (Macours 2012; Maluccio 2005) and one PCS (Ferre 2014) reported the proportion of household expenditure on food. Two cRCTs (Hidrobo 2014; Kurdi 2019) and one PCS (Ferre 2014) reported on dietary diversity measures. Seven cRCTs (Evans 2014; Gertler 2000 (PROGRESA); Kandpal 2016; Kusuma 2017a; Kurdi 2019; Macours 2012; Maluccio 2005; ) and four PCS (Andersen 2015Leroy 2008 (PROGRESA); Lopez Arana 2016; Ferre 2014) reported on various anthropometric measures. Two cRCTs (Baird 2013; Macours 2012) and one PCS (Andersen 2015) reported on cognitive function and development measures. One cRCT (Baird 2013) reported on psychological distress. Four cRCTs reported measures of morbidity (Evans 2014; Gertler 2000 (PROGRESA); Kandpal 2016; Macours 2012). Two PCS reported adverse measures of overweight (Andersen 2015; Lopez Arana 2016). RESULTS: Further details about the studies in this comparison are presented in Table 17. Table 18 presents the results of cRCTs and Table 19 of PCS. Table 2 and harvest plot in Figure 6 summarise the results of CCTs on key outcomes.

FIG: Harvest plot: conditional cash transfers. RESULTS: Primary outcomes RESULTS: 2.1 Change in the prevalence of undernourishment RESULTS: None of the included studies measured prevalence of undernourishment. RESULTS: 2.2 Proportion of household expenditure on food RESULTS: Two cRCTs (Macours 2012; Maluccio 2005) and one PCS (Ferre 2014) reported proportion of household expenditure on food. RESULTS: Randomised controlled trials RESULTS: Evidence from two cRCTs indicated that CCTs result in little to no difference in the proportion of household expenditure on food (4760 households, 2 RCTs; high\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence; Table 2). One study reported a clear effect favouring the control and one study reported an unclear effect potentially favouring the control (P = 0.125) (Figure 6). Both studies were at low overall risk of bias. RESULTS: Maluccio 2005 reported clear effects favouring the control, with an increase in the proportion of household expenditure of 3.9 pp at one year (1490 households; P < 0.01) and of 4.1 pp at two years (1434 households; P < 0.01) (Table 18). RESULTS: Macours 2012 reported an unclear effect potentially favouring the control because among those in the intervention group the proportion of household expenditure increased very slightly by 0.01 SDs (95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.01 to 0.02; 3326 households). RESULTS: Prospective controlled studies RESULTS: Ferre 2014 reported on this outcome but did not report an effect estimate (Table 19). RESULTS: 2.3 Proportion of households who were food secure RESULTS: 2.3.1 Food security RESULTS: None of the studies in this comparison reported food security. RESULTS: 2.3.2 Dietary diversity RESULTS: Randomised controlled trials RESULTS: Evidence from two cRCTs indicated that CCTs probably slightly increase dietary diversity (3937 households; 2 cRCTs; moderate\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence; Table 2; Figure 6) (Hidrobo 2014; Kurdi 2019). A meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis of these two studies, which reported FCS (scale: 0 to 112, higher score indicating better dietary diversity) showed a clear effect favouring CCTs (MD 0.45, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.65; 3937 households; I2 = 0%). Both trials were at high overall risk of bias. RESULTS: Prospective controlled trials RESULTS: Ferre 2014 reported an unclear effect potentially favouring CCT on the proportion of children with MDD (i.e. proportion of children aged six months and above fed from at least four food groups) (Figure 6). The proportion of children with MDD increased by 3.1 pp with CCTs compared to the control group at 13 months (MD 0.03, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.07 to 0.13, n = 1318) (Table 19). RESULTS: Secondary outcomes RESULTS: 2.4 Change in adequacy of dietary intake RESULTS: No included study reported the adequacy of dietary intake. Some studies reported caloric availability and intake; we have not reported these data as they do not relate to measures of adequacy. RESULTS: 2.5 Change in anthropometric indicators RESULTS: Seven cRCTs (Evans 2014; Gertler 2000 (PROGRESA); Kandpal 2016; Kusuma 2017a; Kurdi 2019; Macours 2012; Maluccio 2005) and four PCS (Andersen 2015; Ferre 2014; Leroy 2008 (PROGRESA); Lopez Arana 2016) reported on various anthropometric measures. RESULTS: 2.5.1 Stunting: height\u00e2\u0080\u0090for\u00e2\u0080\u0090age z\u00e2\u0080\u0090scores < \u00e2\u0080\u00932SD (chronic undernutrition) RESULTS: Cluster randomised controlled trials RESULTS: Evidence from four cRCTs (Gertler 2000 (PROGRESA); Kandpal 2016; Kusuma 2017a; Maluccio 2005) showed that CCTs may make little or no difference to the proportion of stunted children (4 RCTs, 3529 children; low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence; Table 2). Three studies showed an unclear effect favouring CCTs and one study showed an unclear effect potentially favouring the control (P = 0.016) (Figure 6). RESULTS: Gertler 2000 (PROGRESA), Kandpal 2016, and Maluccio 2005 reported an unclear effect potentially favouring CCTs. The proportion of stunted children was reduced among those receiving CCTs in these three studies; however, all the 95% CI crossed the null effect (Table 18). In Maluccio 2005, the proportion reduced by 5.3 pp at two years (95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u009311.38 to 0.78; 722 children aged under 5 years); in Gertler 2000 (PROGRESA), the odds of children being stunted was lower by 8.6% at 1.6 years (OR 0.91; 1062 children; P = 0.495); and in Kandpal 2016 the proportion of stunted children was lower by 3.77 pp at three years (95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u009313.83 to 6.29; 351 children younger than 36 months; P > 0.1). Kandpal 2016 also reported that, in the CCT group, the proportion of children who were severely stunted was reduced by 10.19 pp compared to the control group at three years (95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u009318.77 to \u00e2\u0080\u00931.61; 351 children). RESULTS: Kusuma 2017a reported an unclear effect potentially favouring the control. Among children aged 24 to 36 months in the CCT group, the proportion of stunting increased by 3.5 pp (95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00935.5 to 12.5; 1394 children) (Table 18). This study reported a similar effect on the proportion of children who were severely stunted (HAZ < \u00e2\u0080\u00933SD). RESULTS: A meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis of three of these studies showed an unclear effect favouring CCTs (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00932.51, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00937.78 to 2.75; 2467 children; I2 = 22%; Analysis 2.2) (Kandpal 2016; Kusuma 2017a; Maluccio 2005). The two studies that reported on the effects of CCTs on severe stunting could not be pooled due to high heterogeneity (I2 = 78%; Analysis 2.3) (Kandpal 2016; Kusuma 2017a). The cash transfer programmes evaluated in these studies are similar in the cash transfer amount and programme conditions; however, Kusuma 2017a included children aged 24 to 36 months whereas Kandpal 2016 included children under 36 months. They also differed in their overall risk of bias, with Kandpal 2016 at high and Kusuma 2017a at unclear risk. RESULTS: In addition to reporting the effects of CCTs on stunting, five cRCTs reported on mean HAZ (Evans 2014; Kandpal 2016; Kurdi 2019; Macours 2012; Maluccio 2005). A meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis of these studies indicated that CCTs improve mean HAZ (MD 0.09, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.15; 5619 children; I2 = 0%; Analysis 2.4). The follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up period ranged from nine months to three years. Three of the studies in this comparison were at high overall risk of bias (Evans 2014; Kandpal 2016; Kurdi 2019), and the others at low overall risk of bias. A sensitivity analysis of the studies at overall low risk of bias did not affect the results (Appendix 4) (Macours 2012; Maluccio 2005). RESULTS: Prospective controlled studies RESULTS: Three PCS reported on stunting (Lopez Arana 2016, Andersen 2015; Ferre 2014). Two reported unclear effects potentially favouring CCTs and one reported unclear effects potentially favouring the control (P = 0.047; Figure 6; Table 19). All studies were at high overall risk of bias. RESULTS: Lopez Arana 2016 and Andersen 2015 reported unclear effects potentially favouring CCTs. Lopez Arana 2016 reported a reduction in stunting among 2874 children in the intervention group at four years but the CIs overlapped with the null effect (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.05; P > 0.05). In Andersen 2015, there was a smaller proportion of stunted children in the intervention group, both among those receiving the intervention for less than two years (treatment effect: \u00e2\u0080\u00937.98, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u009322.3 to 6.34; 188 children; P = 0.27) as well as those receiving the intervention for longer than two years (treatment effect \u00e2\u0080\u009318.3, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u009338.3 to 1.59; 169 children; P = 0.07). Both of these studies were at high overall risk of bias. RESULTS: Ferre 2014 reported unclear effects potentially favouring the control, with a higher proportion of stunted children in the CCT group by 3.4 pp at approximately one year (95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00936.4 to 13.2). RESULTS: A meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis of two of these studies indicated an unclear effect potentially favouring CCTs (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00935.63, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u009326.59 to 15.34; 1749 children; I2 = 73%; Analysis 2.5) (Andersen 2015; Ferre 2014). RESULTS: In addition to reporting the effects of CCTs on stunting, three PCS, all at high overall risk of bias, reported on mean HAZ (Andersen 2015; Leroy 2008 (PROGRESA); Lopez Arana 2016). The pooled analysis indicated that CCTs may or may not increase HAZ, as the effect could range from a small reduction to a significant increase in HAZ (MD 0.03, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.06 to 0.12; 3475 children, I2 = 0%; Analysis 2.6). RESULTS: 2.5.2. Wasting: weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090for\u00e2\u0080\u0090height z\u00e2\u0080\u0090scores < \u00e2\u0080\u00932SD (acute undernutrition) RESULTS: Four cRCTs (Evans 2014; Kurdi 2019; Kusuma 2017a; Maluccio 2005) and three PCS (Ferre 2014; Leroy 2008 (PROGRESA); Lopez Arana 2016) reported measures related to wasting. RESULTS: Cluster randomised controlled trials RESULTS: Evidence from two cRCTs indicated that CCTs may make little or no difference to wasting (2 trials, 2116 children; low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence; Table 2; Figure 6) (Maluccio 2005; Kusuma 2017a). A meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis showed an unclear effect favouring CCTs (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00932.50, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00938.04 to 3.04; I2 = 70%; Analysis 2.7). RESULTS: Two other trials reported on the effects of CCTs on mean WHZ (Evans 2014; Kurdi 2019). A meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis indicated an unclear effect potentially favouring CCTs (MD 0.17, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.11 to 0.44; 1111 children; I2 = 0%; Analysis 2.8). RESULTS: Prospective controlled studies RESULTS: Two PCS reported on the effects of CCTs on wasting (Lopez Arana 2016; Ferre 2014). One study reported clear effects favouring CCTs and one study unclear effects potentially favouring CCTs (P = 0.125) (Figure 6; Table 19). Data could not be pooled. Both studies were at high overall risk of bias. RESULTS: Lopez Arana 2016 reported a clear effect favouring CCTs. In this study the odds of wasting were reduced by 75% among children in the CCT group at four years (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.74; 2874 children). RESULTS: Ferre 2014 reported an unclear effect potentially favouring CCTs. The proportion of wasted children was lower in the CCT group at 13 months, by 3.6 pp for those that were aged 22 to 46 months when enrolled (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00930.04, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.11 to 0.04) and by 13 pp for those aged 10 to 22 months when enrolled (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00930.13, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.26 to 0.01). However, effects ranged from potential benefit to potential harm. RESULTS: In addition, one PCS, at high overall risk of bias, reported an unclear effect on WHZ potentially favouring CCTs (Leroy 2008 (PROGRESA)). The mean WHZ was higher by 0.085 SDs at two years (95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.11 to 0.28; 432 children; P = 0.2). RESULTS: 2.5.3 Underweight RESULTS: 2.5.3.1 Weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090for\u00e2\u0080\u0090age z\u00e2\u0080\u0090scores < \u00e2\u0080\u00932SD) RESULTS: Three cRCTs reported on the effects of CCTs on the proportion of children who were underweight (Kandpal 2016; Kusuma 2017a; Maluccio 2005). One study reported a clear effect favouring CCTs, and two studies reported unclear effects potentially favouring CCTs (Table 18). A meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis of these studies indicated that CCTs can help reduce underweight (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00934.87, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00938.65 to \u00e2\u0080\u00931.09; 2506 children; I2 = 0%; Analysis 2.9). The study clearly favouring CCTs was at low overall risk of bias. Two of these studies also reported the effects on severe stunting, showing the CCTs may not make a difference to this outcome (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00931.08, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00934.73 to 2.57; 1784 children; I2 = 0%; Analysis 2.10) (Kandpal 2016; Kusuma 2017a). RESULTS: In addition, Evans 2014, Kandpal 2016, and Macours 2012 reported on the effects of CCTs on mean WAZ. The pooled analysis indicated that CCTs slightly increased WAZ by 0.04 SDs in a period ranging from nine months to three years after the intervention (MD 0.04, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.03 to 0.11; 3 trials, 3,548 children; I2 = 0%; Analysis 2.11). Two of these studies were at high overall risk of bias (Evans 2014; Kandpal 2016). RESULTS: Prospective controlled studies RESULTS: One PCS, at high overall risk of bias, reported an unclear effect favouring the control (Ferre 2014). The proportion of children who were underweight increased by 4.6 pp at 13 months among those in the CCT group compared to the control group, but the effects ranged from a decrease to an increase (MD 0.05, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.05 to 0.14; 1638 children) (Table 19). RESULTS: 2.5.3.2 Body mass index\u00e2\u0080\u0090for\u00e2\u0080\u0090age z\u00e2\u0080\u0090score RESULTS: Cluster randomised controlled trials RESULTS: One cRCT at high overall risk of bias reported unclear effects on body mass index\u00e2\u0080\u0090for\u00e2\u0080\u0090age z\u00e2\u0080\u0090score (BMIZ) potentially favouring the control at 1.5 years (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00931.55, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00934.43 to 1.33; P > 0.1; 64 children aged 0 to 4 years; Table 18) (Evans 2014). RESULTS: Prospective controlled studies RESULTS: Two PCS, both at high overall risk of bias, reported on BMIZ, with effects ranging from unclear potentially favouring CCTs to unclear potentially favouring the control (P = 0.125) (Table 19) (Andersen 2015; Lopez Arana 2016). Studies could not be pooled due to high heterogeneity (I2 = 79%; Analysis 2.12). Both studies are at high overall risk of bias. In Lopez Arana 2016, some of the children also participated in a separate childcare supplementary nutrition programme, which could have influenced the effects of the cash transfer. This study included children aged from birth to 17 years, whereas Andersen 2015 included children aged six to 18 months only. RESULTS: Lopez Arana 2016 reported unclear effects potentially favouring CCTs, with BMIZ increasing for children in the intervention group compared to those in the control group (MD 0.14, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.27; P < 0.05; Table 19). RESULTS: Andersen 2015 reported unclear effects on BMIZ potentially favouring the control, both for those receiving the intervention for less than two years (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00930.03, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.31 to 0.25, P = 0.84) and those receiving it for longer than two years (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00930.36, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.79 to 0.06; P = 0.09) (Table 19). RESULTS: 2.6 Change in biochemical indicators RESULTS: No included study addressing this comparison reported biochemical indicators. RESULTS: 2.7 Cognitive function and development RESULTS: Two cRCTs (Baird 2013; Macours 2012) and one PCS (Andersen 2015) reported on cognitive function and development. RESULTS: Cluster randomised controlled trials RESULTS: Evidence from two cRCTs indicated that CCTs slightly improve cognitive function in children (2 RCTs, 5383 children; high\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence; Table 2; Figure 6) (Baird 2013; Macours 2012). Pooled effects indicated that CCTs slightly improve different measures of cognitive function compared to control (SMD 0.13, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.18; I2 = 0%; Analysis 2.13). The measure used in Macours 2012 was a combined measure averaging the effect across two language tests, short\u00e2\u0080\u0090 and long\u00e2\u0080\u0090term memory tests, and two behavioural tests. Baird 2013 used the Ravens Coloured Progressive Matrices test score, which is a measure of abstract reasons in children from the age of five years. For both of these, the higher the score, the more beneficial the effect. RESULTS: Prospective controlled studies RESULTS: Andersen 2015 reported small unclear effects potentially favouring the control on the TVIP score, which is the Spanish\u00e2\u0080\u0090speaking version of the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT), a test of receptive vocabulary that can be applied to children 36 months and older. The TVIP score was reduced by 0.15 SDs in the CCT group compared to the control group (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00930.15, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.37 to 0.07; 243 children; P = 0.17; Table 19). RESULTS: 2.8 Change in proportion of anxiety or depression RESULTS: One cRCT, at low overall risk of bias, reported on psychological distress, with effects ranging from clear effects favouring CCTs at one year to unclear effects potentially favouring CCTs at two years (Table 18) (Baird 2013). Psychological distress was assessed with the General Health\u00c2\u00a0Questionnaire 12, a tool used widely in clinical settings, in which psychological distress is a binary measure of psychological distress, anxiety and depression; social dysfunction; and loss of confidence. The study authors reported that the proportion of school girls with psychological distress reduced in the intervention group both at one year (pp \u00e2\u0080\u00930.06; 2089 girls; P < 0.05) and at two years (pp \u00e2\u0080\u00930.04; 2089 girls; P > 0.1). However, the change was very small and unlikely to be meaningful. This study was at low overall risk of bias. RESULTS: 2.9 Morbidity RESULTS: Four cRCTs report on various morbidity measures (Table 18) (Evans 2014; Gertler 2000 (PROGRESA); Kandpal 2016; Macours 2012). RESULTS: 2.9.1 Illness RESULTS: Three cRCTs reported the\u00c2\u00a0effects of CCTs on illness. A meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis of three of these studies indicated that CCTs may not make a difference to the proportion of people reporting being ill or that reporting seeking care for illness in the past two to four weeks (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00930.28, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00935.92 to 5.35; 38,587 participants; Analysis 2.14). RESULTS: Macours 2012 reported a clear effect favouring CCTs on the number of days ill in bed, which was lower among children in the CCT group compared to the control by 0.357 SDs (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00930.36, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.62 to \u00e2\u0080\u00930.10; 3326 children; Table 18). RESULTS: 2.9.2 Anaemia RESULTS: Gertler 2000 (PROGRESA) reported a clear effect favouring CCTs on anaemia. After 20 months of receiving the intervention, the odds of children being anaemic were 25.5% smaller in children receiving CCTs compared to those receiving no intervention (OR 0.75; 2010 children; P = 0.012). This study was at unclear overall risk of bias (Table 18). RESULTS: 2.10 Adverse outcomes (proportion of overweight/obesity) RESULTS: A meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis of two PCS, both at high overall risk of bias, showed that CCTs make no difference to the proportion of overweight children aged under 18 years at two to four years of the intervention (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.71; 3042 children; I2 = 60%; Analysis 2.15; Table 19) (Andersen 2015; Lopez Arana 2016). RESULTS: Lopez Arana 2016 also reported on the effects of CCTs on obesity. This study\u00c2\u00a0reported an unclear effect favouring CCTs; the risk of obesity was reduced by 44% among children in the intervention group at four years (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.53; 2874 children; P > 0.05). However, effects were uncertain as the CIs crossed the null effect. RESULTS: Comparison 3: income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation interventions RESULTS: Six cRCTs and 11 PCS assessed a variety of interventions aimed at generating income as a means to improve food security through increased economic access to food. Interventions included broad community development programmes that comprised training on livestock management, citizen empowerment, poverty alleviation delivered to women or women's self\u00e2\u0080\u0090help groups (Darrouzet Nardi 2016; Doocy 2017; Osei 2017), training programmes to improve farming practices and sustainable agriculture (Doocy 2017; Kangmennaang 2017), and access to savings and investments and building capacity of local governance structures (Weinhardt 2017). Other interventions aimed to generate income through one\u00e2\u0080\u0090off transfers of livestock with ongoing training (Asadullah 2015; Jodlowski 2016), and in some cases with additional intervention components such as health visits, access to community savings and technical advice (Asadullah 2015). Other studies focused on agriculture\u00e2\u0080\u0090related interventions as a means to generate income: through an integrated agriculture and nutrition programme including training and input provision for crop farming or animal rearing (Marquis 2018; Olney 2016), development of a sustainable integrated agriculture\u00e2\u0080\u0090aquaculture approaches (Murshed E Jahan 2011; Verbowski 2018), a sugarcane farmers scheme (Kennedy 1989), and implementation of a solar\u00e2\u0080\u0090powered irrigation systems (Alaofe 2016; Alaofe 2019). Three PCS evaluated employment interventions, including public works programmes (Porter 2016; Beegle 2017), and part\u00e2\u0080\u0090time employment for women (Katz 2001). RESULTS: Four PCS assessed effects on food security outcomes (Asadullah 2015; Doocy 2017; Kangmennaang 2017; Weinhardt 2017). Three cRCTs (Beegle 2017; Darrouzet Nardi 2016; Olney 2016) and three PCS (Alaofe 2019; Doocy 2017; Jodlowski 2016) reported various measures of dietary diversity. Four cRCTs (Darrouzet Nardi 2016; Marquis 2018; Olney 2016; Verbowski 2018) and five PCS (Alaofe 2019; Doocy 2017; Katz 2001; Kennedy 1989; Weinhardt 2017) reported on various anthropometric measures. One cRCT (Verbowski 2018) and three PCS (Alaofe 2019; Asadullah 2015; Kennedy 1989) reported on morbidity outcomes.

FIG: Harvest plot: income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation interventions. RESULTS: Primary outcomes RESULTS: 3.1 Change in the prevalence of undernourishment RESULTS: None of the included studies measured prevalence of undernourishment. RESULTS: 3.2 Proportion of household expenditure on food RESULTS: We found no evidence about the effect of income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation interventions on the proportion of household expenditure on food. Although two PCS mentioned this outcome in their manuscript, they did not report relevant numerical data or indicate clearly the direction of the effect (Alaofe 2016; Kennedy 1989). Four other PCS reported total expenditure on food, not in relation to income or total expenditure and these results are thus not reported here (Asadullah 2015; Jodlowski 2016; Katz 2001; Murshed E Jahan 2011). RESULTS: 3.3 Proportion of households who were food secure RESULTS: Two cRCTs reported the effects on food security of interventions where households received training for activities such as livestock management, aquaculture interventions and community development through women's self\u00e2\u0080\u0090help groups (Darrouzet Nardi 2016; Osei 2017), whereas two cRCTs assessed the effects of an integrated agriculture and nutrition programme (Olney 2016; Marquis 2018). In one cRCT, households participated in a public works programme in Malawi (Beegle 2017). Six PCS assessing different interventions reported different food security or dietary diversity measures (Alaofe 2019; Asadullah 2015; Doocy 2017; Jodlowski 2016; Kangmennaang 2017; Weinhardt 2017). RESULTS: 3.3.1 Food security RESULTS: Cluster randomised controlled trials RESULTS: Evidence from one cRCT suggested that income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation interventions may result in little to no difference in food security of households who receive these interventions, compared to households who do not (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00930.06, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.22 to 0.1; 2193 households; low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence; Table 3). A cRCT from Malawi showed an unclear effect potentially favouring the control on household food security scores, after three to four months (Figure 7) (Beegle 2017). One RCT did not report an overall effect estimate for the proportion of households experiencing food security (based on HFIAS) after 2.5 years, following the implementation of an agricultural and nutrition training programme in women from rural villages In Nepal (Osei 2017). RESULTS: Prospective controlled studies RESULTS: Three PCS reported clear effects favouring the intervention on measures of food security and one PCS reported unclear effects favouring the intervention (P = 0.01) (Figure 7). RESULTS: Asadullah 2015, Doocy 2017, and Kangmennaang 2017 reported a clear effect favouring the intervention. In Asadullah 2015, among participants receiving a multicomponent intervention including training and transfer of productive assets for an income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation enterprise, the proportion of households that reported always experiencing a food deficit decreased compared to the control group over a period of nine years (at 3 years: pp \u00e2\u0080\u009328.85; P < 0.01; at 6 years: pp \u00e2\u0080\u009317.15; P < 0.0; at 9 years: pp \u00e2\u0080\u009313.91; P < 0.01; all 4038 households). In Doocy 2017, the combined effect of both groups of the interventions (where farmer field schools and women empowerment groups in farming villages) showed a clear effect favouring the intervention, with a decrease in mean HFIAS compared to control villages not receiving any intervention (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00934.23, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00934.96 to \u00e2\u0080\u00933.49; 1119 households). In Kangmennaang 2017, the implementation of a training and development programme for farmers resulted in a clear effect favouring the intervention, with a decrease in mean HFIAS in intervention households compared to control households (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00930.30; 1000 households; P < 0.01) (Table 21). These studies could not be pooled due to high heterogeneity (I2 = 99%; Analysis 3.1). Both studies are at high overall risk of bias. The interventions differed. Doocy 2017 assessed a programme including women empowerment groups, where weekly meetings and training were provided regularly as well as start\u00e2\u0080\u0090up materials, and farmer field schools, where farmers received semi\u00e2\u0080\u0090monthly training in farming practices as well as business and administration. Kangmennaang 2017 assessed an intervention in which farmers experimented with agroecological innovations and which also included sharing knowledge and training on various aspects including leadership. RESULTS: Weinhardt 2017 reported an unclear effect potentially favouring the intervention. This study assessed a multilevel health and development intervention including training on farming practices, and access to VSLs groups. The odds of being food secure (i.e. household that had zero months where there was insufficient food to meet their needs in the previous 12 months) increased by 36% at 1.5 years (OR 1.36, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.97; 827 participants; P = 0.108) and 12% at three years (OR 1.12, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.67; 827 participants; P = 0.585). RESULTS: 3.3.2 Dietary diversity RESULTS: Four cRCTs (Beegle 2017; Darrouzet Nardi 2016; Marquis 2018; Olney 2016) and three PCS (Alaofe 2019; Doocy 2017; Jodlowski 2016) reported on seven different measures of dietary diversity. Definitions and explanations of dietary diversity measures reported here are provided in Table 12. RESULTS: Cluster randomised controlled trials RESULTS: Evidence from four RCTs suggests that income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation interventions may improve dietary diversity in children and may result in little or no difference to household dietary diversity (4 cRCTs, 3677 households and 3790 children; low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence; Table 3). Two cRCTs reported a clear effect favouring income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation interventions (Darrouzet Nardi 2016; Marquis 2018), one reported an unclear effect favouring the intervention (Olney 2016), and one reported an unclear effect favouring the control group (Beegle 2017) (P = 0.047; Figure 7). RESULTS: A meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis of two of these trials, assessing a public works programme in Malawi and an integrated agriculture and nutrition programme including provision of inputs and training, showed that income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation interventions make no difference to the HDDSs at three months to two years (SMD 0.02, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.09 to 0.13; 3677 households; I2 = 63%; Analysis 3.2) (Beegle 2017; Olney 2016). Beegle 2017 was at high and Olney 2016 at unclear overall risk of bias. Beegle 2017 measured dietary diversity using the FCS (scale: 0 to 126) and Olney 2016 used the HDDS (scale: 0 to 11); for both, the higher the score, the higher the food diversity. Another meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis of three of these cRCTs, assessing the implementation of women's groups, agricultural and nutritional training, and community development, showed that children in intervention households were 1.28 times more likely to achieve MDD, compared to children from control households, one to two years after the implementation of the interventions (OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.47; 3790 children; Analysis 3.3) (Darrouzet Nardi 2016; Marquis 2018; Olney 2016). Marquis 2018 was at low overall risk of bias and Darrouzet Nardi 2016 and Olney 2016 were at unclear overall risk of bias. RESULTS: Prospective controlled studies RESULTS: Two PCS reported a clear effect favouring income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation interventions and one study reported an unclear effect potentially favouring income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation interventions on dietary diversity (Figure 7). A meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis of these studies indicated that income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation interventions increase the HDDS (MD 0.67, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.05; 1571 households; I2 = 67%; Analysis 3.4) (Alaofe 2019; Doocy 2017; Jodlowski 2016). Doocy 2017 assessed farmer field schools or women's empowerment groups at 3.5 years, Alaofe 2019 assessed the installation of a low\u00e2\u0080\u0090pressure drip irrigation system, combined with a solar\u00e2\u0080\u0090powered water pump in each intervention village, and Jodlowski 2016 assessed a livestock transfer with training support. All studies were at high overall risk of bias. RESULTS: Secondary outcomes RESULTS: 3.4 Change in adequacy of dietary intake RESULTS: Prospective controlled studies RESULTS: Although one PCS reported two measures of dietary intake adequacy among participants of an intervention where smallholder sugarcane growers were enrolled in a scheme to provide sugarcane to a new factory, the study authors did not report any effect measures (Kennedy 1989). RESULTS: 3.5 Change in anthropometric indicators RESULTS: Four cRCTs (Darrouzet Nardi 2016; Olney 2016; Osei 2017; Verbowski 2018) and six PCS (Alaofe 2019; Asadullah 2015; Doocy 2017; Katz 2001; Kennedy 1989; Weinhardt 2017) reported nine different anthropometric measures in children and women. RESULTS: 3.5.1 Stunting: height\u00e2\u0080\u0090for\u00e2\u0080\u0090age z\u00e2\u0080\u0090scores < \u00e2\u0080\u00932SD (chronic undernutrition) RESULTS: Four cRCTs (Darrouzet Nardi 2016; Osei 2017; Marquis 2018; Verbowski 2018) and two PCS (Doocy 2017; Kennedy 1989) reported on stunting. RESULTS: Cluster randomised controlled trials RESULTS: Evidence from two trials indicated that income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation interventions probably make little or no difference to wasting (2 trials, 3500 children; moderate\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence; Table 3) (Osei 2017; Verbowski 2018). A meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis of these two studies showed no difference to stunting (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.19; I2 = 0%; Analysis 3.5). RESULTS: In addition to reporting the proportion of children who are stunted, Marquis 2018, Darrouzet Nardi 2016, and Osei 2017 reported on the effect of income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation interventions on mean HAZ. Data from these studies could not be pooled due to high heterogeneity (I2 = 100%; Analysis 3.6). Marquis 2018 was at low overall risk of bias whereas Darrouzet Nardi 2016 and Osei 2017 were at unclear risk. All three studies assessed some form of training on agricultural practices or livestock management but, in all but one (Darrouzet Nardi 2016), nutrition and health education sessions were also provided, with which the most beneficial effects were observed. If this study was removed from the meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis, heterogeneity reduced to 0%. All three studies reported a clear effect favouring income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation interventions at 1 to 2.5 years of follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up. In Marquis 2018, the mean HAZ increased by 0.22 SD with the intervention at 12 months (95% CI 0.10 to 0.34; 428 children); the study assessed an integrated package of agricultural inputs and training as well as education in nutrition, health care and child stimulation for participants. In Darrouzet Nardi 2016, it increased by 0.03 SD in the intervention group, which included training for poverty alleviation, citizen empowerment, community development and optimisation of livestock management as means to generate income (95% CI 0.02 to 0.04; 609 children). However, the effect was unclear potentially favouring the intervention at one year. In Osei 2017, which assessed an enhanced homestead food production (EHFP) programme encompassing training in improved gardening and poultry\u00e2\u0080\u0090rearing practices, among others, it increased by 0.22 SD at 2.5 years (95% CI 0.22 to 0.22; 2569 children) (Table 20). RESULTS: Prospective controlled studies RESULTS: Two PCS reported on stunting (Doocy 2017; Kennedy 1989). One study, assessing an income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation intervention with women's groups and farmer field schools, reported an unclear effect potentially favouring the control, with an increase in the proportion of stunted children at 3.5 years (MD 1.4, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u009310.7 to 13.6; P = 0.81, 471 children) (Table 21) (Doocy 2017). The other study did report any effect measures (Kennedy 1989). RESULTS: 3.5.2 Wasting: weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090for\u00e2\u0080\u0090height z\u00e2\u0080\u0090scores < \u00e2\u0080\u00932SD (acute undernutrition) RESULTS: Three cRCTs (Marquis 2018; Osei 2017; Verbowski 2018) and one PCS (Kennedy 1989) reported on wasting. RESULTS: Cluster randomised controlled trials RESULTS: Evidence indicated that income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation interventions probably make little or no difference to wasting (2 cRCTs, 3500 children; moderate\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence; Table 3). A meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis of these two cRCTs showed an unclear effect potentially favouring the control, with an increased risk of wasting in children in the intervention group at two years (OR 1.13 95% CI 0.92 to 1.40; I2 = 0%; Analysis 3.7) (Osei 2017; Verbowski 2018). RESULTS: In addition, Marquis 2018 and Osei 2017 reported on the effects of income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation interventions on the mean WHZ. Data could not be pooled due to high heterogeneity (I2 = 85%; Analysis 3.8). Marquis 2018 reported a clear effect favouring the control (MD 0.07, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.087 to 0.227; 429 children), and Osei 2017 reported an unclear effect favouring the income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation intervention (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00930.14, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.142 to \u00e2\u0080\u00930.138; 2603 children) (Table 20). RESULTS: 3.5.3 Underweight RESULTS: 3.5.3.1 Weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090for\u00e2\u0080\u0090age z\u00e2\u0080\u0090scores < \u00e2\u0080\u00932SD RESULTS: Three cRCTs (Darrouzet Nardi 2016; Marquis 2018; Osei 2017) and three PCS (Doocy 2017; Kennedy 1989; Weinhardt 2017) reported on weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090for\u00e2\u0080\u0090age measures. RESULTS: Cluster randomised controlled trials RESULTS: A meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis of two cRCTs showed that income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation interventions make little or no difference to the percentage of children who are underweight in households that receive the intervention compared to households that did not, after two years follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up (MD 1.06, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.26; 3808 children; I2 = 4%; Analysis 3.9) (Osei 2017; Verbowski 2018). RESULTS: In addition, three cRCTs reported on the effect of income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation interventions on WAZ (Darrouzet Nardi 2016; Marquis 2018; Osei 2017). Data could not be pooled due to high heterogeneity (I2 = 99%; Analysis 3.10). Two studies reported a clear effect favouring income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation interventions and Osei 2017 reported no effect at 2.5 years (MD 0.00, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.00 to 0.00; 2613 children). RESULTS: Prospective controlled studies RESULTS: Two studies reported on the effects of income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation interventions on the percentage of children who were underweight (Doocy 2017; Weinhardt 2017). A meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis of these studies showed that these interventions make no difference to the percentage of children who are underweight (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.12; 909 children; I2 = 16%; Analysis 3.11). No effect measures could be calculated for Kennedy 1989. RESULTS: 3.5.3.2 Body mass index RESULTS: Two cRCTs (Olney 2016; Osei 2017) and three PCS (Alaofe 2019; Asadullah 2015; Kennedy 1989) reported on BMI measures in women. RESULTS: Cluster randomised controlled trials RESULTS: Two cRCTs reported a clear effect favouring income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation interventions on the proportion of women who were underweight (BMI< 18.5 kg/m2) (Olney 2016; Osei 2017) and one study reported an unclear effect potentially favouring the control (Verbowski 2018) (P = 0.047). Data could not be pooled due to high heterogeneity (I2 = 80%; Analysis 3.12). Heterogeneity seemed to be driven by Verbowski 2018, which was the only study with an aquaculture component in the intervention. All three studies were a variation of the EHFP intervention, so similar in other characteristics. RESULTS: Olney 2016 and Osei 2017 reported a clear effect favouring income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation interventions. Olney 2016 reported that the proportion of underweight women in the intervention group was 8.7 pp lower compared to the control group at two years (1297 women; P = 0.01). Osei 2017 reported reduced odds of underweight among women in the intervention group by 39% at two years (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.82; 2614 mothers) (Table 20). Both studies were at unclear overall risk of bias. RESULTS: Verbowski 2018 reported an unclear effect potentially favouring the control, with the proportion of underweight women being higher in the intervention group by 3.88 pp (95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00934.36 to 12.12; 911 women) (Table 20). This study was at unclear overall risk of bias. RESULTS: In addition Olney 2016 and Osei 2017 reported on the mean BMI in women. A meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis of these two cRCTs reported little or no effect on the mean BMI of women from households who received income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation interventions, such as integrated agriculture and nutrition programmes or community development programmes, compared to women from households who did not, after two years of follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00930.02, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.28 to 0.25; 2 RCTs, 3911 women; Analysis 3.13). RESULTS: Prospective controlled studies RESULTS: One PCS reported an unclear effect on the proportion of underweight women in the villages with the intervention, compared to women from villages who did not, after one year of follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00930.22, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.75 to 0.31; 359 women) (Table 21) (Alaofe 2019). RESULTS: Three studies reported on the effect on mean BMI in women. Effect measures for mean BMI could not be calculated for one PCS (Kennedy 1989). The other two studies reported an unclear effect potentially favouring the intervention (P = 0.063). Asadullah 2015 did not report the variance of effect for mean BMI of women (MD 0.14; P = 0.29). Alaofe 2019 reported an unclear effect on the mean BMI of women, favouring the intervention (the installation of solar\u00e2\u0080\u0090powered irrigation systems), compared to the mean BMI of women from households in villages where the technology was not available, after one year of follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up (difference in differences (DID) 0.43, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.05 to 0.89; 359 women; P < 0.1). RESULTS: 3.5.4 Mid\u00e2\u0080\u0090upper arm circumference RESULTS: One PCS reported no difference in the mean MUAC of women who were part of an employment intervention compared to women in the control group, in Nepal at two years; the mean change in the intervention group was \u00e2\u0080\u00930.20 cm and in the control group was \u00e2\u0080\u00930.25 cm (718 women; P = 0.67) (Katz 2001). RESULTS: 3.6 Change in biochemical indicators RESULTS: Two cRCTs reported biochemical indicators, such as haemoglobin levels in women and children (Osei 2017; Verbowski 2018), and one PCS reported iron and vitamin A deficiency in women (Alaofe 2019). RESULTS: Cluster randomised controlled trials RESULTS: A meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis of two cRCTs showed a clear effect on mean haemoglobin levels in children, favouring income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation interventions (MD 3.49, 95% CI 3.25 to 3.72; 2 RCTs, 3808 children; Analysis 3.14) (Osei 2017; Verbowski 2018). We could not pool the data for women due to high heterogeneity (I2 = 96%; Analysis 3.15). Osei 2017 reported a clear effect on haemoglobin levels favouring income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation interventions at 2.5 years (MD 4.6, 95% CI 4.59 to 4.61; 2614 mothers), whereas Verbowski 2018 reported an unclear effect potentially favouring the control (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00930.07, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00931.92 to 1.78; 811 women) (Table 20). Both studies were at unclear overall risk of bias. RESULTS: Prospective controlled studies RESULTS: Alaofe 2019 reported unclear effects favouring the intervention (the installation of solar\u00e2\u0080\u0090powered irrigation systems) for the proportion of women with iron deficiency (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00930.11, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.94 to 0.72; 68 women; P > 0.05), and favouring the control for the proportion of women with vitamin A deficiency (MD 0.54, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.41 to 1.49; P > 0.05; 60 women) (Table 21). RESULTS: 3.7 Cognitive function and development RESULTS: None of the studies included in this comparison reported cognitive function and development. RESULTS: 3.8 Change in proportion of anxiety or depression RESULTS: None of the studies included in this comparison reported proportion of anxiety or depression. RESULTS: 3.9 Morbidity RESULTS: Cluster randomised controlled trials RESULTS: Two cRCTs report on morbidity measures, such as the prevalence of anaemia in women and children (Osei 2017; Verbowski 2018). A meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis of these showed a clear effect favouring income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation interventions on the proportion of children with anaemia, after two years of follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.88; 2 RCTs, 3808 children; Analysis 3.16). However, in women, these interventions resulted in an unclear effect favouring the control after follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up for two years (OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.38; 2 RCTs, 3696 women; Analysis 3.17). RESULTS: Prospective controlled studies RESULTS: Three PCS reported unclear effects different morbidity measures (Alaofe 2019; Asadullah 2015; Kennedy 1989). RESULTS: Asadullah 2015 reported an unclear effect potentially favouring the intervention in the proportion of household members reporting serious illness in the previous year, over nine years of the intervention, with this proportion reducing both in the intervention and the control group (3 years: pp \u00e2\u0080\u00931.72, P > 0.1; 6 years: pp \u00e2\u0080\u00930.78, P > 0.1; 9 years: pp \u00e2\u0080\u00930.70, P > 0.1; 4038 households). This study is at high overall risk of bias. Kennedy 1989 reported a higher percentage of time being ill among those in the intervention group (sugarcane growers scheme) at two years; both for children (29.8% with intervention versus 31.2% with control; 1055 children) and for women (23.8 with intervention versus 24.3% with control; 420 women). In terms of the percent of time children were ill with diarrhoea, this was higher in the intervention group at two years (4.6 with intervention versus 4.0% with control; 1055 children). However, the study reported no baseline values or effect measures, which was at unclear overall risk of bias. Alaofe 2019 reported a clear effect favouring income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation interventions on the prevalence of anaemia in women from intervention households, compared to control households (at 1 year: MD \u00e2\u0080\u00931.25, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00931.83 to \u00e2\u0080\u00930.67; 126 women; P = 0.05); the effect was unclear favouring the intervention for the prevalence of iron\u00e2\u0080\u0090deficiency anaemia in women from intervention households compared to control households (at 1 year: MD \u00e2\u0080\u00930.99, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00932.39 to 0.41; 546 women; P > 0.05). RESULTS: 3.10 Adverse outcomes (proportion of overweight/obesity) RESULTS: None of the studies included in this comparison reported proportion of overweight/obesity. RESULTS: Comparison 4: food prices \u00e2\u0080\u0093 food vouchers RESULTS: Three cRCTs (Fenn 2015; Hidrobo 2014; Ponce 2017) and one RCT (Jensen 2011) reported the effects of food vouchers compared to no intervention. Food vouchers are provided to households or individuals for the purchase of food, which could be specific to particular foods or for any foods, and usually can be redeemed at specific vendors. Hidrobo 2014 provided vouchers to households, to the value of USD 40 per month, that could be redeemed at specific supermarkets in urban areas in Ecuador for nutritionally approved foods within 30 days of receiving the vouchers. Participants in this study also had to attend monthly nutrition sensitisation sessions. Fenn 2015 provided monthly fresh food vouchers with a cash value of 1500 PKR (approximately USD 14), which could be exchanged for specified fresh foods (fruits, vegetables, milk and meat) in nominated shops in Pakistan. Vouchers were distributed at specific distribution points either by mobile banks that travelled to a central location serving some of the participating villages or through central banks that served a number of villages. In Ponce 2017, households in Ecuador received a food voucher of USD 40 monthly. In Jensen 2011, a month's supply of vouchers entitled participants to a price reduction of the local staple food to the value of 750 g per person per day of that staple food. More details on these studies are available in Table 22 and in the Characteristics of included studies table.

RESULTS: 4.3 Proportion of households who were food secure RESULTS: 4.3.1 Dietary diversity RESULTS: Evidence from two trials reported that food vouchers may improve dietary diversity slightly (2 RCT, 2459 households; low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence; Table 4) (Hidrobo 2014; Ponce 2017). Both studies reported clear effects favouring the intervention (P = 0.063; Figure 8). RESULTS: In Hidrobo 2014, at seven months, among households in the food voucher group the FCS was higher by 9.4 points (out of maximum score of 112) (95% CI 6.6 to 12.2; 2087 households; P < 0.01). Other measures of dietary diversity reported in Hidrobo 2014 also indicate clear effects favouring food vouchers (Table 23). In Ponce 2017, the FCS increased by 0.39 points in the intervention group (95% CI 0.30 to 0.49). Pooled analysis was not possible because numbers per group were not reported for Hidrobo 2014 and thus SMD could not be calculated (Analysis 4.1). Both studies were at high overall risk of bias. RESULTS: Secondary outcomes RESULTS: 4.4 Change in adequacy of dietary intake RESULTS: Jensen 2011 reported an unclear effect potentially favouring the control on the mineral and vitamin sufficiency indices (Table 23). These indices reflect the mean intake per person relative to the Dietary Reference Intake (DRI). Among households in the intervention group, there was a reduction in the mineral sufficiency index compared to the control group (percentage change \u00e2\u0080\u00930.06, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.22 to 0.10), and a reduction in the vitamin sufficiency index (percentage change \u00e2\u0080\u00930.05, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.22 to 0.12) at five months. However, the CIs crossed the null. This study was at low overall risk of bias. RESULTS: 4.5 Change in anthropometric indicators RESULTS: One cRCT reported on stunting, wasting and underweight (Fenn 2015). This study was at low overall risk of bias. RESULTS: 4.5.1 Stunting: height\u00e2\u0080\u0090for\u00e2\u0080\u0090age z\u00e2\u0080\u0090scores < \u00e2\u0080\u00932SD RESULTS: Fenn 2015 reported that food vouchers probably reduce stunting (1 trial; moderate\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence; Table 4). At 12 months' follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up, the odds of stunting was 52% less in the food voucher group compared to control. This study reported a similar effect on other measures of stunting; it reported a reduction in the proportion of children who are severely stunted (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.79; 1633 children), and an increase in the mean HAZ at 12 months (MD 0.29, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.40; 1633 children; Table 23). RESULTS: 4.5.2 Wasting: weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090for\u00e2\u0080\u0090height z\u00e2\u0080\u0090scores < \u00e2\u0080\u00932SD RESULTS: Fenn 2015 reported that food vouchers may result in little to no difference in wasting (1 trial, 1633 children; low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence; Table 4). At 12 months of follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up, it reported an unclear effect potentially favouring the control (Figure 8); the odds of stunting were 17% higher in the food voucher group compared to the control; however, this effect ranged from 25% reduction to an 82% increased odds of stunting. Similar effects are reported for severe wasting at six months (OR 1.27, 95% CI 0.45 to 3.55; 1643 children); however, for mean WHZ they reported unclear effect favouring the food vouchers at 12 months (coefficient 0.02, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.1 to 0.14; 1633 children; Table 23). RESULTS: 4.5.3 Underweight RESULTS: Fenn 2015 reported two different measures of underweight. In children, it reported an unclear effect on MUAC at six months (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00930.05, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.14 to 0.04; 1643 children). In mothers, they reported a clear effect on BMI favouring food vouchers (MD 0.29 kg/m2, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.54; 1204 mothers; Table 23). RESULTS: 4.6 Change in biochemical indicators RESULTS: None of the included trials reported biochemical indicators. RESULTS: 4.7 Cognitive function and development RESULTS: None of the included trials reported cognitive function and development. RESULTS: 4.8 Change in proportion of anxiety or depression RESULTS: None of the included trials reported proportion of anxiety or depression. RESULTS: 4.9 Morbidity RESULTS: None of the included trials reported morbidity. RESULTS: 4.10 Adverse outcomes (proportion of overweight/obesity) RESULTS: None of the included trials reported proportion of overweight/obesity. RESULTS: Comparison 5: food prices \u00e2\u0080\u0093 food and nutrition subsidies RESULTS: One cRCT (Chen 2019) and three PCS (Andaleeb 2016; Chakrabarti 2018; Sturm 2013) assessed the effects of food and nutrition subsidies. These interventions aim to address rising food prices by reducing the price of the foods for the consumer, and are usually provided by the government. Chen 2019 assessed the provision of a one\u00e2\u0080\u0090off nutrition subsidy with a monetary equivalent of CYN 225 (USD 33) per enrolled student to schools in China, which they could use for nutrition\u00e2\u0080\u0090related expenses (e.g. buying food). Schoolmasters received information about the proportion of enrolled students who were anaemic; elective methods for reducing iron\u00e2\u0080\u0090deficient anaemia; and details about anaemia's relation with school attendance, educational performance, and cognitive development. Andaleeb 2016 assessed the public distribution system (PDS) in India, in which households with a ration card were eligible for 25 kg of subsidised rice. A ration card was a document issued by the government which entitled an individual/family to purchase from the PDS, and which was also used as an identity card for other government schemes. Chakrabarti 2018 also assessed the PDS in India, but this study subsidised a variety of pulses in different districts as part of the PDS, in addition to the usual subsidising of rice, wheat, sugar and kerosene oil. Sturm 2013 assessed cash rebates on food purchases. It reports on the HealthyFood programme, which provides a rebate between 10% and 25% on healthy food purchases in designated supermarkets in South Africa for members of the Vitality programme of Discovery Health Insurance scheme. More details about this study are available in Table 17 and in the Characteristics of included studies table. RESULTS: Chen 2019 reported on dietary diversity, anthropometric, biochemical and morbidity measures. Sturm 2013 reported on the proportion of household expenditure on food. Andaleeb 2016 reported on adequacy of dietary intake. Although Chakrabarti 2018 reported food security, dietary diversity and the proportion of household expenditure on food, it did not report any relevant measure under any of these outcome domains. RESULTS: Further details of these studies are presented in Table 22. Results of included trials are presented in Table 24 and PCS in Table 25. The harvest plot is presented in Figure 9.

FIG: Harvest plot: food and nutrition subsidies. RESULTS: Primary outcomes RESULTS: 5.1 Change in the prevalence of undernourishment RESULTS: None of the included studies measured prevalence of undernourishment. RESULTS: 5.2 Proportion of household expenditure on food RESULTS: Evidence from one study was very uncertain about the effects of food rebates on household expenditure on healthy foods (1 study, 169,485 households; very low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence; Table 5) (Sturm 2013). This study reported clear effects favouring cash rebates on proportion of healthy to total household food expenditure (Figure 9). The study authors reported that food rebates increased the ratio of healthy to total food expenditure: the 10% rebated increased it by 6% at three years (95% CI 5.3 to 6.8; 169,485 households), and the 25% rebate increased it by 9.3% at two years and four months (95% CI 8.5 to 10.0; 136,484 households) (Table 25). This study was at high overall risk of bias due to high risk of selection bias. RESULTS: 5.3 Proportion of households who were food secure RESULTS: One cRCT reported the effects of nutrition subsidies on dietary diversity (Chen 2019). RESULTS: 5.3.1 Dietary diversity RESULTS: Evidence from one trial indicated that nutrition subsidies may improve dietary diversity among school children (1 RCT, 656 children; low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence; Table 5) (Chen 2019). This study reported a clear effect favouring nutrition subsidies (Figure 9); at six months, the dietary diversity score of school children in the subsidy group increased 0.956 points more (almost one more food group) more than in the control group (MD 0.96, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.45). This study was at high overall risk of bias. RESULTS: Secondary outcomes RESULTS: 5.4 Change in adequacy of dietary intake RESULTS: Andaleeb 2016 reported on the adequacy of dietary intake for energy, protein and fat (Table 25). At seven years, it reported a clear effect favouring food subsidies for the ratio of protein intake to the recommended daily allowance (RDA) (DID 3.75, 95% CI 0.52 to 6.98; n = NR), an unclear effect potentially favouring food subsidies for the ratio of current caloric intake to the RDA (DID 2.55, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.02 to 5.12; n = NR), and unclear effects potentially favouring the control on the ratio of fat intake to the RDA (DID \u00e2\u0080\u00930.1, SE 0.00; P > 0.1). RESULTS: 5.5 Change in anthropometric indicators RESULTS: Chen 2019 reported on anthropometric indicators. RESULTS: 5.5.1 Underweight (body mass index z\u00e2\u0080\u0090score < \u00e2\u0080\u00932SD) RESULTS: Chen 2019 reported an unclear effect potentially favouring nutrition subsidies (Table 24). The proportion of underweight children reduced in the schools receiving the nutrition subsidy by 3.2 pp compared to the control schools; however, the CIs crossed the null (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00930.03, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.08 to 0.02, 656 children). There was a similar effect in mean BMIZ (Table 24). In the group where a monetary incentive was provided if the school achieved the desired targets, the effect was similar for the proportion of children who were underweight, but it clearly favoured nutrition subsidies for BMIZ. This study was at high overall risk of bias. RESULTS: 5.6 Change in biochemical indicators RESULTS: 5.6.1 Haemoglobin RESULTS: Chen 2019 reported an unclear effect potentially favouring the intervention at six months on the mean concentration of haemoglobin in school children (MD 0.51, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00932.13 to 3.15; n = 656; Table 24). Adding a monetary incentive resulted in a clear effect favouring nutrition subsidies (MD 4.49, 95% CI 2.06 to 6.92). RESULTS: 5.7 Cognitive function and development RESULTS: None of the included studies measured cognitive function and development. RESULTS: 5.8 Change in proportion of anxiety or depression RESULTS: None of the included studies measured anxiety or depression. RESULTS: 5.9 Morbidity RESULTS: 5.9.1 Anaemia RESULTS: Chen 2019 reported an unclear effect potentially favouring nutrition subsidies on the proportion of school children with anaemia at six months (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00930.005, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.1 to 0.09). Adding a monetary incentive resulted in a clear effect favouring nutrition subsidies (Table 24). This study was at high overall risk of bias. RESULTS: 5.10 Adverse outcomes (proportion of overweight/obesity) RESULTS: None of the included studies measured overweight/obesity. RESULTS: Comparison 6: social support RESULTS: Two included studies assessed social support interventions. One cRCT in Indonesia randomised subdistricts to receive a community cash grant or to a control group, which were linked to health and education conditionalities (Kusuma 2017b). Two intervention groups were implemented, one with and one without a performance incentive, but the effect of both is reported together. One PCS randomised households either to a VSL group or to a VSL and Ajuda Mutua (AM) group, or to a control group (Brunie 2014). VSLs are self\u00e2\u0080\u0090managed and capitalised microfinance programmes where members pool savings and can borrow from the pool and repay with interest. AM is a rotating labour scheme, where groups of households work together on each family's land or enterprise on a rotational basis. A combined effect of both groups is reported. RESULTS: Kusuma 2017b reported effects on anthropometric indicators, and Brunie 2014 reported effects on measures of food security, dietary diversity and anthropometry.

RESULTS: 6.3 Proportion of households who were food secure RESULTS: One PCS reported on food security and dietary diversity measures (Brunie 2014). RESULTS: 6.3.1 Food security RESULTS: The evidence was very uncertain about the effects of VSLs on food security (MD 1.25, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.28 to 2.79; 851 households; very low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence; Table 6; Figure 10). Brunie 2014 reported an unclear effect potentially favouring the VSL intervention on the number of self\u00e2\u0080\u0090reported months of food sufficiency in the previous year, with an increase by 1.25 months in the intervention group at three years (Table 27). RESULTS: 6.3.2 Dietary diversity RESULTS: The evidence was very uncertain about the effects of VSLs on dietary diversity (1 study, 802 households; very low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence; Table 6; Figure 10). Brunie 2014 reported an unclear effect on household dietary diversity favouring the control (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00930.30, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00931.46 to 0.87; 1615 households) (Table 27). RESULTS: Brunie 2014 also reported on Individual Dietary Diversity Scores (IDDS) among children: IDDS was slightly higher by 0.81 points (out of 12) in the VSL group (MD 0.52, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.18 to 1.23; 1121 children) (Table 27). RESULTS: Secondary outcomes RESULTS: 6.4 Change in adequacy of dietary intake RESULTS: None of the included studies measured adequacy of dietary intake. RESULTS: 6.5 Change in anthropometric indicators RESULTS: One trial reported on stunting, wasting and underweight measures (Kusuma 2017b). One PCS reported on underweight measures (Brunie 2014). RESULTS: 6.5.1 Stunting (height\u00e2\u0080\u0090for\u00e2\u0080\u0090age z\u00e2\u0080\u0090scores < \u00e2\u0080\u00932SD) RESULTS: Community grants may make little or no difference to stunting (1 trial, 1481 children; low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence; Table 6; Figure 10). Kusuma 2017b reported an unclear effect on stunting favouring the control (3.4 pp, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00937.4 to 14.2; 1481 children aged 24 to 36 months). The effect on severe stunting (HAZ < \u00e2\u0080\u00933SD) was different: they reported an unclear effect favouring the community cash grants (\u00e2\u0080\u00936 pp, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u009316.4 to 4.4; 1481 children aged 24 to 36 months; Table 26).

Kusuma 2017b reported an unclear effect favouring the intervention at two years (\u00e2\u0080\u00931.0 pp, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00937.9 to 5.9). The effect on severe wasting (WHZ < \u00e2\u0080\u00933SD) was similar (\u00e2\u0080\u00932.1 pp, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00937 to 2.8; Table 26). RESULTS: 6.5.3 Underweight: weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090for\u00e2\u0080\u0090age z\u00e2\u0080\u0090scores < \u00e2\u0080\u00932SD RESULTS: Randomised controlled trials RESULTS: Kusuma 2017b reported an unclear effect on stunting favouring community cash grants (\u00e2\u0080\u00932 pp, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u009311.9 to 7.9; 1481 children). The effect on severe underweight (WAZ < \u00e2\u0080\u00933SD) was similar (Table 26). This study was at unclear overall risk of bias. RESULTS: Prospective controlled studies RESULTS: Brunie 2014 reported an unclear effect on WAZ potentially favouring the VSL intervention (with or without a rotating labour scheme). Among children in the intervention group, the mean WAZ increased slightly by 0.05 SDs compared to the control group at three years (MD 0.05, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.37 to 0.48; 1053 children; Table 27). RESULTS: 6.6 Change in biochemical indicators RESULTS: None of the included studies measured biochemical indicators. RESULTS: 6.7 Cognitive function and development RESULTS: None of the included studies measured cognitive function and development. RESULTS: 6.8 Change in proportion of anxiety or depression RESULTS: None of the included studies measured anxiety or depression. RESULTS: 6.9 Morbidity RESULTS: None of the included studies measured morbidity. RESULTS: 6.10 Adverse outcomes (proportion of overweight/obesity) RESULTS: None of the included studies measured proportion of overweight/obesity. DISCUSS: Discussion DISCUSS: Summary of main results DISCUSS: Fifty\u00e2\u0080\u0090nine studies, addressing six intervention types, met the criteria for inclusion in this review. Some studies evaluated the same programme. None of the studies included assessed the primary outcome of prevalence of undernourishment. DISCUSS: Sixteen cRCTs, two parallel\u00e2\u0080\u0090group RCTs and three PCS assessed UCTs. Available evidence indicates that UCTs improve food security (six RCTs) and make little or no difference to cognitive function and development (three RCTs) (high\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence); UCTs may increase dietary diversity (10 RCTs) and may reduce stunting (four RCTs) (low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence); and that the evidence regarding the effects of UCTs on the proportion of household expenditure on food (five RCTs) and wasting (four RCTs) is very uncertain (very low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence). Regarding adverse outcomes, evidence from one trial indicates that UCTs reduce the proportion of infants who are overweight. DISCUSS: Nine cRCTs and five PCS assessed CCTs. None of these studies reported on food security measures. Available evidence indicates that CCTs result in little to no difference in the proportion of household expenditure on food (two RCTs) and that they slightly improve cognitive function in children (two RCTs) (high\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence); that CCTs probably slightly improve dietary diversity (two RCTs) (moderate\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence); and that they may make little to no difference to stunting (four RCTs) or wasting (two RCTs) (low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence). Evidence on adverse outcomes (two PCS) shows that CCTs make no different to the proportion of overweight children. DISCUSS: Six cRCTs and 11 PCS assessed income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation interventions. None of these studies reported on cognitive function and development, or the proportion of household expenditure on food. Available evidence indicates that income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation interventions make little or no difference to stunting (two RCTs) or wasting (two RCTs) (moderate\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence); and that they may results in little to no difference to food security (two RCTs) and may improve dietary diversity in children but not for households (four RCTs) (low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence). DISCUSS: Four trials reported on food vouchers. None reported on the proportion of households expenditure on food, food security, or cognitive function and development. Available evidence indicates that food vouchers probably reduce stunting (one RCT) (moderate\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence), and that they may improve dietary diversity slightly (two RCTs) and may result in little to no difference in wasting (one RCT) (low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence). DISCUSS: One RCT and three PCS reported the effects offood and nutrition subsidies. None of these studies reported on food security, stunting, wasting, or cognitive function and development. Available evidence indicates that food and nutrition subsidies may improve dietary diversity among school children (one RCT) (low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence), and the evidence is very uncertain about the effects on household expenditure on healthy foods as a proportion of total expenditure on food (very low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence). DISCUSS: One RCT and one PCS reported on the effects of social environment interventions. None of the studies reported on the proportion of household expenditure on food, or on cognitive function and development. Available evidence indicates that community grants probably make little to no difference to wasting (one RCT) (moderate\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence) and that they make little or no difference to stunting (one RCT) (low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence); and the evidence is very uncertain about the effects of VSLs on food security (one PCS) and dietary diversity (one PCS) (very low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence). DISCUSS: Overall completeness and applicability of evidence DISCUSS: We considered the differences between the evidence identified and our prespecified eligibility criteria, including relevant gaps identified with the harvest plots regarding outcomes with no data, when assessing the completeness and applicability of the evidence. DISCUSS: Participants in included studies ranged from households to individuals, including adults and children. A few studies specifically targeted women as recipients of the intervention. Most studies targeted poor households, and mostly in rural areas, based on specific criteria to identify poor and vulnerable households. Although we had planned to assess effects within specific disadvantaged subgroups, this was not possible because of unclear reporting about these types of characteristics in the included studies. DISCUSS: Our logic model showed that there is a wide range of interventions that could address access to food. Across all the possible interventions, we included mostly studies aiming to increase buying power, including UCTs, CCTs, and income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation interventions. Fewer studies addressed food prices and only two assessed social environment interventions, namely a community cash grant programme, and a VSLs programme. We found no studies assessing infrastructure interventions that aimed to improve physical access to food. Some of the studies we excluded from this review assessed some of these relevant interventions, but they were conducted in high\u00e2\u0080\u0090income countries. For example, one before\u00e2\u0080\u0090after study that assessed the implementation of a fruit and vegetable market in low\u00e2\u0080\u0090income neighbourhoods (Gorham 2015), which addressed lack of infrastructure; a randomised trial that assessed financial incentives to increase fruit and vegetable intake among participants in the USA Food Stamp programme (Olsho 2016), which addresses high food prices. This illustrates, perhaps, a lack of such interventions being implemented in LMIC settings. Regarding the variation in type and intensity of interventions, particularly of CCTs and how the conditions and the enforcement of these components vary across interventions, we were unable to distinguish which specific conditionalities were linked to the outcome based on available data. In these interventions, conditionalities ranged from attending clinic visits, educational sessions and school attendance. For other interventions such as income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation interventions, intervention components also varied significantly, and it is difficult to specify which intervention components are associated with the observed outcome. DISCUSS: In majority of studies, the intervention was not compared with another intervention. For some larger studies of government programmes, such as cash transfers, it was common for a delayed control to be used as a comparator. In this case, the control group also received the intervention, but at a later stage, as it would be unethical to randomise communities to no intervention in these types of programmes. One issue with this was that many long\u00e2\u0080\u0090term outcomes were not eligible for reporting in this review as, by that time, both the intervention and control groups were receiving the intervention. DISCUSS: In terms of outcomes, no included study reported on the primary outcome of prevalence of undernourishment. Prevalence of Undernourishment (PoU) is a national\u00e2\u0080\u0090level model\u00e2\u0080\u0090based indicator used to understand access to food in terms of dietary energy inadequacy and can be measured at national or household level (INDDEX Project 2018). It measures the percentage of the population whose dietary energy intake is below the MDER. In line with this, the adequacy of dietary intake at the individual level was also not reported in most studies, and only six studies reported this outcome. Most studies reported on actual energy intake (i.e. calories) or intake of specific nutrients (i.e. grams), without assessing this intake against some measure of adequacy, such as the DRIs. Besides these outcome categories, fewer studies reported on child cognitive function and development compared to other outcomes. We had intended to assess not only if adequacy of dietary intake improved, but also if diet quality increased. Included studies did not report on dietary quality (i.e. whether they were refined and high in saturated fat or healthier foods such as legumes, fruit and vegetables). However, many studies reported on dietary diversity, which is an approximate measure of diet quality. Greater dietary diversity should indicate better overall dietary quality, as it means that foods from more food groups are being consumed. For most outcomes, data were available at two and three years, so there is not much evidence on longer\u00e2\u0080\u0090term impact of included interventions. Only three studies reported on the adverse outcome of overweight and obesity. DISCUSS: Due to the lack of information in many included studies, we were unable to address our first secondary objective \u00e2\u0080\u0093 to identify features of interventions that enable or impair the effective implementation. We believe this warrants a separate study assessing each intervention more in\u00e2\u0080\u0090depth and using different study designs, such as qualitative studies. DISCUSS: Quality of the evidence DISCUSS: We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach and presented our findings in a 'Summary of findings' table for each comparison. For all comparisons except comparison 6, the 'Summary of findings' tables included only data from RCTs, as there were data from at least one RCT for the key outcomes. The 'Summary of findings' tables for comparisons 5 and 6 include data from RCTs and PCS, as for specific outcomes there were no data from RCTs. DISCUSS: For UCTs, the certainty of the evidence ranged from very low to high across outcomes. Reasons for downgrading included inconsistency due to wide variance of point estimates, imprecision due to wide CIs and due to high overall risk of bias. DISCUSS: For CCTs, the certainty of the evidence ranged from low to high across outcomes. Reasons for downgrading included inconsistency due to wide variation in point estimates, high overall risk of bias and imprecision due to wide CIs. DISCUSS: For income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation interventions, the certainty of the evidence ranged from low to moderate across outcomes. Reasons for downgrading included imprecision due to wide CIs, indirectness because the evidence was from a single study, high overall risk of bias and inconsistency due to wide variation in point estimates. DISCUSS: The certainty of the evidence on food voucher interventions ranged from low to moderate across outcomes. Reasons for downgrading included high overall risk of bias, inconsistency as CIs had minimal overlap, indirectness as findings were from one single study and imprecision due to findings ranging from an important harm to important benefit. DISCUSS: The certainty of the evidence on food and nutrition subsidies ranged from very low to low across outcomes. Reasons for downgrading included high overall risk bias and indirectness as the results were from a single study. DISCUSS: For VSLs, the certainty of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. Reasons for downgrading included indirectness, as the results were from a single study, and imprecision, due to wide CIs. DISCUSS: All but one included study was funded by a for\u00e2\u0080\u0090profit organisation and 66.1% did not report on potential COI. DISCUSS: Potential biases in the review process DISCUSS: We followed Cochrane Review methodology to prevent potential biases from being introduced into the review process. Nevertheless, potential biases could have been introduced due to the nature of subjective decisions that had to be made while conducting the review and because the protocol was outdated and new methods had emerged since its publication (Durao 2015). DISCUSS: Multiple outcome measures concerning the same outcome category were reported across included studies. Since there is no guidance in the literature on what measures are considered as 'gold standard' for measuring food and nutrition security, we selected the most comprehensive or largest scale measure reported for the same outcome domain in the same study. For example, we reported changes in z\u00e2\u0080\u0090scores for height or weight but we did not report actual height (in centimetre) or weight (kilogram) measures. We judged changes in z\u00e2\u0080\u0090scores to be more useful and easier to interpret as they are assessing standardised height and weight attainment adjusted for age and sex. Still, multiplicity of outcome measures made it difficult to include all studies reporting the same outcome domain in meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analyses. DISCUSS: We also could not include all studies in meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analyses due to incomplete reporting of the required data (e.g. variance measures). Therefore, we made post\u00e2\u0080\u0090hoc decisions about synthesising the evidence using vote counting based on effect direction, using harvest plots to visually illustrate the results. We used the point estimates and the 95% CI to decide how to categorise the effects of the studies. However, data for these were sometimes not available or could not be calculated, and thus we had to base decisions regarding whether the effect was clear or unclear based on the P value. DISCUSS: As we had not prespecified the outcomes to be assessed using GRADE in the protocol (Durao 2015), we had to make this decision post\u00e2\u0080\u0090hoc. The author team discussed and agreed through consensus which outcomes we considered best for informing decision\u00e2\u0080\u0090making. However, it may be that another group could have made different decisions regarding which outcomes to highlight in the 'Summary of findings' tables. All outcomes are, however, reported in the review text and in the tables of individual results. We also had to prioritise outcome measures to report in the review as often there were multiple outcome measures reported in the same study for the same outcome domain. We attempted to prevent introduction of biases by selecting an approach that was independent of the effect measure reported (i.e. prioritising the most comprehensive outcome measure). DISCUSS: Our interpretation of the primary outcome 'proportion of household expenditure on food' was based on Engel's Law \"\u00e2\u0080\u00a6according to which the household decreases its budget share of food as its income increases\". This is the interpretation used in one of the included studies (Brugh 2018). Not all included studies interpreted this outcome in the same way, with some interpreting an increase in this proportion as 'good' while others interpreting a decrease as 'good'. Furthermore, not all studies clearly interpreted their findings. This variability led us to interpret it based on Engel's law. While food expenditure is expected to increase with higher income, the proportion of expenditure on food in relation to other expenditure should decrease. The use of this approach may explain some of the diversity in effect measures observed for this outcome. DISCUSS: Due to our high search yield we were unable to complement the electronic database search with screening reference lists of included studies, reference lists of identified relevant systematic reviews or websites of specific organisations, as planned. Thus, we may have missed some relevant studies. However, since our search was very comprehensive, we believe that the chance of this was small. DISCUSS: One limitation of our review was that the synthesis was unable to draw conclusions about the mean effect size for many outcomes, due to limited availability of suitable data. However, we have tried to calculate all necessary information for meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis where this was possible. DISCUSS: Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews DISCUSS: Other recent reviews on food access tend to focus on individual interventions rather than on a comprehensive review of the evidence base of interventions addressing access to food like ours. DISCUSS: We identified six published reviews among the results of the updated search for this review which addressed access to food or included similar interventions to those included in this review. Three reviews addressed cash transfers (Baird 2014; Hunter 2017; Melo 2016); two reviews evaluated interventions related to the income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation category (Bird 2019; Pullar 2018); two reviews focused on interventions addressing food prices (Mizdrak 2015; Alagiyawanna 2015); and one review addressed interventions addressing infrastructure, for which we did not find any studies to include in our review (Hsiao 2019). DISCUSS: Of the reviews addressing cash transfers, two had a different focus to our review: one on the effect of cash transfers on educational outcomes (Baird 2014), and one on use and quality of maternity care services (Hunter 2017). The third review included 10 studies of cash transfer interventions in Latin America and reported a positive association of cash transfers with children's anthropometric status (Melo 2016). However, they also reported that improvements may differ by age and that the included studies, which varied in design, were of questionable methodological quality. DISCUSS: Other systematic reviews on cash transfers had a different focus than that of our review; they assessed the effects of such interventions on improving infant vaccination (Munk 2019), women economic empowerment (Leite 2019), clinical outcomes for pulmonary tuberculosis (Richterman 2018), or social determinants of health (Owusu\u00e2\u0080\u0090Addo 2018). Of those that had a similar focus, some reported positive effects or no effects. One review of cash transfer programmes including different types of literature assessed the evidence of the impact of cash transfers on a range of individual\u00e2\u0080\u0090 or household\u00e2\u0080\u0090level outcomes in 201 included studies, of which 89 reported on health and nutrition outcomes, including the use of health services, dietary diversity and anthropometry (Bastagli 2016). They reported a greater proportion of significant results for dietary diversity than for anthropometric measures, but positive impacts in relation to the cash transfer interventions overall. Another review assessed universal and targeted UCTs and targeted CCTs and reported mostly positive effects of these interventions on birth weight, infant mortality, among other outcomes (Siddiqi 2018). Another review assessed the effects of CCTs on child health in LMICs (Owuso\u00e2\u0080\u0090Addo 2014), and included 16 studies predominantly from Latin America. The review authors reported that programmes improved nutritional status of children in intervention compared to control groups in terms of, for example, growth in height and weight, decreased chance of being underweight, and improved dietary intake of protein and vegetables. However, some of the programmes did not always find an effect on anthropometric outcomes such as childhood wasting or stunting. Of note, these two reviews included the same studies as this Cochrane Review. Therefore, it is perhaps unsurprising that their findings were similar to ours. In one Cochrane Review of UCTs for reducing poverty and vulnerabilities and its effects on health services use and health outcomes in LMICs, the authors also reported that UCTs had beneficial effects on food security and dietary diversity, with evidence certainty ranging from low to moderate, and uncertain effects on stunting due to very low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence (Pega 2017). DISCUSS: Of the two reviews addressing income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation interventions, results were similar, with some potential positive effect on diet intake and diversity. Bird 2019 assessed agriculture interventions on nutrition outcomes in specific countries in South Asia (India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan and Afghanistan) where agriculture activities are major sources for the livelihoods of large sections of the population. They included six studies assessing interventions of provision of seeds, plants and training, or livestock and training, or both, and reported a positive impact on intermediate outcomes, such as diet quality and diversity, but mixed results regarding impact on nutritional outcomes, such as anthropometry and anaemia. No meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analyses were carried out due to high heterogeneity. Pullar 2018 assessed the effects of poverty reduction and development interventions on non\u00e2\u0080\u0090communicable disease (NCD) prevalence and risk. They included 29 studies, mostly of agricultural interventions, and reported limited methodological quality in included studies and high heterogeneity of outcome measures, similarly to our review. Included studies failed to measure and report on NCD prevalence and risk, but they reported that intensive agricultural interventions were associated with improved calorie, vitamin, fruit and vegetable intake, with the effects being dependent on other factors such as land ownership and infection status. However, the findings had poor generalisability because of small sample sizes and use of convenience samples of population with the highest need. DISCUSS: Both reviews of interventions addressing food prices focused on obesity reduction and not on undernutrition. Alagiyawanna 2015 assessed the effects of fiscal interventions implemented at national or local levels to improve diets and reduce obesity, assessing effects on consumption and health outcomes in adults and children. They included 18 studies, mostly from high\u00e2\u0080\u0090income countries. Nine of these studies assessed the impact of taxes and these were all were from high\u00e2\u0080\u0090income countries. They reported that the effects of taxation of soft drinks and its consumption was mixed, as was the effect on BMI among children and adolescents. Existing taxation studies tend to be from high\u00e2\u0080\u0090income countries, which is likely the reason why we did not find any taxation\u00e2\u0080\u0090related studies to include in our review, which only focused on LMICs. Regarding subsidies, in high\u00e2\u0080\u0090income countries, Alagiyawanna 2015 reported positive associations with fruit and vegetable intake, maternal weight gain, increase in mean haemoglobin levels, consumption of healthy foods and height\u00e2\u0080\u0090for\u00e2\u0080\u0090age, but no association with BMI, low birthweight or fetal survival. One study in a low\u00e2\u0080\u0090 to middle\u00e2\u0080\u0090income country reported a negative association of subsidies with increased obesity. The Mizdrak 2015 review assessed fiscal interventions, but its scope was to specifically assess which personal characteristics influence differential impact of fiscal interventions, as this is considered a barrier to implementation. They included eight studies from high\u00e2\u0080\u0090income countries, reporting high heterogeneity between studies and population groups concerning the effects of fiscal measures on healthy diets. Although they reported that the evidence pointed towards a differential impact depending on personal characteristics, the data were limited and underpowered to detect effects according to personal characteristics. DISCUSS: Hsiao 2019 assessed the barriers and facilitators of mobile produce markets in the US. This is a category of interventions for which we did not find studies to include in our review (i.e. infrastructure interventions), likely because these types of studies currently tend to be from high\u00e2\u0080\u0090income countries. They reported a positive association of mobile produce markets and fruit and vegetable intake, but noted that the quality of the evidence was problematic as the studies were found not to be rigorous in their design and had high potential for selection and other types of bias. DISCUSS: An important aspect about this review is that it included interventions addressing upstream factors affecting access to food, that do not only rely on individual agency. This has been globally recognised as the best approach to address over\u00e2\u0080\u0090 and undernutrition, and cash transfers specifically are high on the agenda of many countries as they address the social determinants of health (Hawkes 2020; Owusu\u00e2\u0080\u0090Addo 2018). These types of interventions fall under the category of double duty actions that address both under\u00e2\u0080\u0090 and overnutrition at the same time, especially if complemented by education and behaviour change communication and regular check\u00e2\u0080\u0090ups as part of the intervention (Hawkes 2020). CONCL: Authors' conclusions CONCL: Implications for practice CONCL: This review provides policy makers with a comprehensive evidence base, ranging from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to prospective controlled studies, evaluating the effects of a wide range of community\u00e2\u0080\u0090level interventions to address access to food in low\u00e2\u0080\u0090 and middle\u00e2\u0080\u0090income countries (LMICs). CONCL: The body of evidence indicates that unconditional cash transfers (UCTs) can improve food security, income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation interventions do not seem to make a difference for food security, but the evidence is unclear for the other interventions. Conditional cash transfers (CCTs), UCTs, those that help generate income, and those that help minimise impact of food prices through food vouchers and subsidies can potentially improve dietary diversity. UCTs and food vouchers may have a potential impact on reducing stunting, but CCTs, income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation interventions or social environment interventions do not seem to make a difference on wasting or stunting. CCTs seem to positively impact cognitive function and development but not UCTs. This may be due to the fact that in CCTs, beneficiaries are required to meet specific conditionalities such as attending school, visiting the health clinic regularly for growth monitoring or supplementation. None of the included studies reported on the primary outcome prevalence of undernourishment; in retrospect this was expected given that this is mostly used as a national\u00e2\u0080\u0090level indicator of food security. CONCL: We found no studies reporting specific adverse outcomes. Three studies, one assessing UCTs and two assessing CCTs, reported on increased risk of overweight and obesity, our predefined adverse outcome. The effects on this outcome are unclear and we should thus not discard overweight and obesity as potential harms of these interventions. This is particularly problematic because in LMIC populations, where these interventions are implemented, overweight and obesity are often already a problem. Hawkes 2020 reported that this was the case in cash or food transfers and voucher interventions in Mexico, Egypt and the US where the unintended negative outcomes of these programmes include poorer diet quality and obesity and diabetes\u00e2\u0080\u0090related NCDs, due to increased intake of foods high in energy, sugar, fat and salt, resulting from the programme itself, or from the income from the programme that enabled people to purchase these types of foods. In some cases, the targeted populations experienced both undernutrition and overnutrition, such as the existence of undernourished children and obese mothers in the same household or community. Thus it is possible that these programmes may exacerbate existing problems. Potential solutions to prevent this could be related to specifying which types of foods can be purchased with interventions such as vouchers, and accompanying health education with transfers. CONCL: As these interventions are often implemented at national level, direct implications for practitioners and the community are less clear. Organisations involved in the development and implementation of interventions to improve access to food may be able to better focus their time and resources by optimally designing or choosing programmes which maximise the intended outcome. CONCL: Implications for research CONCL: Here, we draw on the EPICOT framework \u00e2\u0080\u0093 which stands for Evidence, Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcomes, and Time stamp (Brown 2006) \u00e2\u0080\u0093 to suggest gaps in the evidence base that future research could address. There is enough evidence from RCTs for CCTs and UCTs but not for the other intervention types assessed in this review (i.e. those addressing food prices (e.g. policies, discounts, vouchers and subsidies); addressing infrastructure and transport that affect physical access to food outlets; and those addressing the social environment and providing social support (e.g. social support from family, neighbours or government)). CONCL: In general, higher\u00e2\u0080\u0090quality RCTs and prospective controlled studies are required, particularly concerning methods to minimise the issues with selection and attrition bias. CONCL: The multiplicity of outcome measures made analysis for this review challenging. It is thus important for future studies to have a similar set of outcomes that we can usefully compare across studies, and that are most relevant for assessing food and nutrition security at the community or household level. If primary studies measured similar outcomes, it would have likely been possible to pool the majority of results across included studies for this review, resulting in clearer review findings. CONCL: None of the included studies clearly and specifically reported on adverse events. Although these types of interventions do not tend to have the same extent of harms as a clinical intervention, for example, it is still important to consider what the potential harms may be. Although overweight or obesity is a potential harm, the studies did not report on this as such. CONCL: Most studies reported results from one to two years of the intervention. Longer\u00e2\u0080\u0090term studies of interventions aimed to improve food access in vulnerable communities or households are required.

TABLE: Ahmed 2019a TABLE: Study characteristics\t \tMethods\tStudy design: cRCTStudy grouping: parallel groupHow were missing data handled? NR but based on Table 1 reporting baseline data for fewer number of participants than randomised we assume that missing data were excluded.Randomisation ratio: 1:1:1:1:1 (village\u00e2\u0080\u0090level randomisation)Recruitment method: NRSample size justification and outcome used: sample size calculations undertaken to assess the number of clusters (villages) and HHs needed to detect changes in both HH\u00e2\u0080\u0090 and child\u00e2\u0080\u0090level outcomes. Using data from an earlier study in Bangladesh (Ahmed et al. 2010), setting significance level at 0.05 and statistical power at 0.80, assuming attrition of 10% over duration of intervention, and using outcome\u00e2\u0080\u0090specific means, SDs and intracluster correlations, a sample based on 50 clusters per treatment and 10 HHs per cluster would provide sufficient statistical power to detect an increase of: 12% in HH per capita total expenditure per month; 7% in HH per capita calorie intake per day; 16% in child HAZ; and 8% in dietary diversity of children aged 12\u00e2\u0080\u009360 months.Sampling method: same process followed for each region \u00e2\u0080\u0093 North and South: in North, 5 upazilas (subdistricts) were selected using simple random sampling from a list of upazilas where in 2010 the proportion of HHs living below Bangladesh's lower poverty line was \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 25%. All villages within these 5 upazilas were listed. Villages classified as urban or with < 125 HHs were dropped. Using a random number generator, each village was assigned a random number. Villages were then sorted in ascending numerical order with the first 275 retained. Given that in each region, there were 4 treatment groups and a control group, the first 50 villages were assigned to treatment group 1, the second 50 to treatment group 2, the third 50 villages to treatment group 3, the fourth 50 villages to treatment group 4 and the fifth 50 villages to the control group. The remaining 25 villages were held as a reserve. A complete village census was carried out in each of the 250 selected villages, collecting information on HH demographics, a set of poverty indicators, and whether HHs participated in safety nets and other targeted interventions. Using these data, a list was compiled of HHs that: 1. were considered poor (i.e. based on the poverty indicators collected, they were estimated to have consumption below Bangladesh's lower poverty line); 2. would have \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 1 child aged 0\u00e2\u0080\u009324 months when the intervention began; and 3. were not receiving benefits from other safety net interventions. These HHs were eligible to participate in the study. Using simple random sampling, 10 eligible HHs were selected from each village. The total sample in the North included 250 clusters and 2500 HHs. An identical process was used in the South to select upazilas, villages and HHs.Study aim or objective: to devise and implement 2 \u00c3\u0097 2\u00e2\u0080\u0090year RCTs in 2 poor rural areas of Bangladesh with both cash and food treatment groups. Building on the work of Black et al. (2013), the intervention also included 2 treatment groups that aimed to improve maternal knowledge and practices surrounding infant and young child nutrition \u00e2\u0080\u0093 through BCC \u00e2\u0080\u0093 thus making those treatment groups nutrition\u00e2\u0080\u0090sensitive. We designed survey instruments to capture impacts at the child level, both for the key outcome measure of child anthropometry and for individual\u00e2\u0080\u0090level mechanisms that plausibly underlie programme impacts. Using the RCT design, they estimated impacts of each treatment on child height\u00e2\u0080\u0090for\u00e2\u0080\u0090age. In the other paper, the authors assessed its implications for economic outcomes.Study period: 24 months: baseline survey was carried out in March\u00e2\u0080\u0093April 2012, the endline survey was conducted in April 2014.Unit of allocation or exposure: villages\t \tParticipants\tBaseline characteristicsCash onlyAge: child: months (mean): North: 13.1 (SD 6.8), South: 13.8 (SD 6.1); mothers: years (mean): North: 26.5 (SD 5.8), South: 27.1 (SD 5.9)Place of residence: rural areaSex, %: female: 47.4 (50.0)Ethnicity and language: NROccupation: NREducation: schooling grades mean: North: 2.9 (SD 3.1), South: 3.5 (SD 3.3).

BCC component that was included in the fourth treatment group in each region consisted of a suite of intensive nutrition BCC activities ('Cash and BCC'). The core activity was a weekly, 1\u00e2\u0080\u0090hour group session in each village with a trained CNW. These sessions covered a defined series of 6 topics: 1. importance of nutrition and diet diversity for health; 2. how handwashing and hygiene improve health; 3. diet diversity and micronutrients; 4. breastfeeding; 5. complementary foods for children aged 6\u00e2\u0080\u009324 months; and 6. maternal nutrition. Several methods were used to deliver this information including presentations, question and answer, interactive call and answer songs and chants, practical demonstrations, and role playing. 1 of these sessions, with only beneficiaries participating, occurred on the day of the transfer distribution. For the remaining group, BCC training each month, other HH members \u00e2\u0080\u0093 particularly mothers\u00e2\u0080\u0090in\u00e2\u0080\u0090law, husbands, and other pregnant or lactating women \u00e2\u0080\u0093 were invited to attend along with beneficiaries, with the intention of creating a supportive HH atmosphere and behaviour change at the HH level. CNWs also made home visits to beneficiaries twice a month to follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up on topics discussed during group sessions and to discuss specific concerns that mothers had.Duration of intervention period: 24 months, May 2012 to April 2014Frequency: monthly transfers; on second week of each month; BCC: main activity was weeklyNumber of study contacts: 3: baseline (2012), midline (2013), endline (2014)Providers: designed and evaluated by the IFPRI and implemented by the United Nations' WFP.

An NGO contracted by WFP, the ESDO, was responsible for the field implementation of project activities, including distributing the monthly food and cash transfers, and delivering the nutrition BCC (Ahmed 2019 b)Delivery: cash delivered using a mobile phone cash transfer system, in which women collected cash from designated distribution sites using mobile verification of identity. While attendance at these BCC sessions was a condition for receipt of transfers, this was a 'soft' condition. When a mother missed a session, the CNW followed up with a home visit to ascertain why the session had been missed, and there were no cases where a beneficiary was dropped from the study for failing to attend sessions. In addition, CNWs staff conducted community meetings and met with influential members (village leaders, imams, elders) of the villages in which the BCC took place to explain the purposes of the nutrition training and to provide them with the information being conveyed to study participants. CNWs received training prior to the start of the intervention. In localities where the same payment point was used for both the cash group and the cash + BCC group, cash beneficiaries were paid in the morning while cash + BCC beneficiaries were paid in the afternoon to minimise the likelihood of information from the BCC activities spilling over to the cash treatment group. Both quantitative and qualitative data collected throughout the intervention indicated that implementation fidelity was high.Co\u00e2\u0080\u0090interventions: NRResource requirements: NREconomic indicators: USD 19 per month + BCC activities cost approximately USD 50 per year per beneficiaryFood onlyFood access intervention category: N/AIntervention type: food provisionDescription: consisted of a monthly food ration of 30 kg of rice, 2 kg of mosoor pulse (a type of lentil), and 2 L of micronutrient\u00e2\u0080\u0090fortified cooking oil.

The BCC intervention involved 3 complementary activities: 1. weekly group BCC trainings \u00e2\u0080\u0093 some with beneficiaries only (i.e. the target women in the Food+BCC or Cash+BCC groups) and some that invited other family members to attend along with beneficiaries, 2. twice\u00e2\u0080\u0090a\u00e2\u0080\u0090month visits by CNWs to the beneficiaries' homes, and 3 monthly group meetings between programme staff and influential community leaders.

We note that one might be concerned that BCC could lead to social desirability bias affecting the IYCDDS responses \u00e2\u0080\u0093 i.e. after 2 years of nutrition training, mothers might respond to questions about child feeding by over\u00e2\u0080\u0090reporting foods commonly discussed during the group training sessions. The fact that there were differences between what mothers in the North described and what mothers in the South described \u00e2\u0080\u0093 e.g. that mothers receiving BCC in the South did not report feeding their children dairy products more frequently than those in the control group \u00e2\u0080\u0093 despite their receiving identical BCC gave us some confidence in these results. TABLE: Ahmed 2019b TABLE: Study characteristics\t \tMethods\tStudy design: cRCTStudy grouping: parallel groupHow were missing data handled? NR but based on Table 1 reporting baseline data for fewer number of participants than randomised we assume that missing data were excluded.Randomisation ratio: 1:1:1:1:1 (village\u00e2\u0080\u0090level randomisation)Recruitment method: NRSample size justification and outcome used: sample size calculations undertaken to assess the number of clusters (villages) and HHs needed to detect changes in both HH\u00e2\u0080\u0090 and child\u00e2\u0080\u0090level outcomes. Using data from an earlier study in Bangladesh (Ahmed et al. 2010), setting significance level at 0.05 and statistical power at 0.80, assuming attrition of 10% over duration of intervention, and using outcome\u00e2\u0080\u0090specific means, SDs and intracluster correlations, a sample based on 50 clusters per treatment and 10 HHs per cluster would provide sufficient statistical power to detect an increase of: 12% in HH per capita total expenditure per month; 7% in HH per capita calorie intake per day; 16% in child HAZ; and 8% in dietary diversity of children aged 12\u00e2\u0080\u009360 months.Sampling method: same process followed for each region \u00e2\u0080\u0093 North and South: in North, 5 upazilas (subdistricts) were selected using simple random sampling from a list of upazilas where in 2010 the proportion of HHs living below Bangladesh's lower poverty line was \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 25%. All villages within these 5 upazilas were listed. Villages classified as urban or with < 125 HHs were dropped. Using a random number generator, each village was assigned a random number. Villages were then sorted in ascending numerical order with the first 275 retained. Given that in each region, there were 4 treatment groups and a control group, the first 50 villages were assigned to treatment group 1, the second 50 to treatment group 2, the third 50 villages to treatment group 3, the fourth 50 villages to treatment group 4 and the fifth 50 villages to the control group. The remaining 25 villages were held as a reserve. A complete village census was carried out in each of the 250 selected villages, collecting information on HH demographics, a set of poverty indicators, and whether HHs participated in safety nets and other targeted interventions. Using these data, a list was compiled of HHs that: 1. were considered poor (i.e. based on the poverty indicators collected, they were estimated to have consumption below Bangladesh's lower poverty line); 2. would have \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 1 child aged 0\u00e2\u0080\u009324 months when the intervention began; and 3. were not receiving benefits from other safety net interventions. These HHs were eligible to participate in the study. Using simple random sampling, 10 eligible HHs were selected from each village. The total sample in the North included 250 clusters and 2500 HHs. An identical process was used in the South to select upazilas, villages and HHs.Study aim or objective: to devise and implement 2 \u00c3\u0097 2\u00e2\u0080\u0090year RCTs in 2 poor rural areas of Bangladesh with both cash and food treatment groups. Building on the work of Black et al. (2013), the intervention also included 2 treatment groups that aimed to improve maternal knowledge and practices surrounding infant and young child nutrition \u00e2\u0080\u0093 through BCC \u00e2\u0080\u0093 thus making those treatment groups nutrition\u00e2\u0080\u0090sensitive. We designed survey instruments to capture impacts at the child level, both for the key outcome measure of child anthropometry and for individual\u00e2\u0080\u0090level mechanisms that plausibly underlie programme impacts. Using the RCT design, they estimated impacts of each treatment on child height\u00e2\u0080\u0090for\u00e2\u0080\u0090age. In the other paper, the authors assessed its implications for economic outcomes.Study period: 24 months: baseline survey was carried out in March\u00e2\u0080\u0093April 2012, the endline survey was conducted in April 2014.Unit of allocation or exposure: villages\t \tParticipants\tBaseline characteristicsCash onlyAge: child: months (mean): North: 13.1 (SD 6.8), South: 13.8 (SD 6.1); mothers: years (mean): North: 26.5 (SD 5.8), South: 27.1 (SD 5.9)Place of residence: rural areaSex: % female: 54.6 (49.8)Ethnicity and language: NROccupation: NREducation: schooling grades mean: North: 2.9 (SD 3.1), South: 3.5 (SD 3.3).

BCC component that was included in the fourth treatment group in each region consisted of a suite of intensive nutrition BCC activities ('Cash and BCC'). The core activity was a weekly, 1\u00e2\u0080\u0090hour group session in each village with a trained CNW. These sessions covered a defined series of 6 topics: 1. importance of nutrition and diet diversity for health; 2. how handwashing and hygiene improve health; 3. diet diversity and micronutrients; 4. breastfeeding; 5. complementary foods for children aged 6\u00e2\u0080\u009324 months; and 6. maternal nutrition. Several methods were used to deliver this information including presentations, question and answer, interactive call and answer songs and chants, practical demonstrations, and role playing. 1 of these sessions, with only beneficiaries participating, occurred on the day of the transfer distribution. For the remaining group, BCC training each month, other HH members \u00e2\u0080\u0093 particularly mothers\u00e2\u0080\u0090in\u00e2\u0080\u0090law, husbands, and other pregnant or lactating women \u00e2\u0080\u0093 were invited to attend along with beneficiaries, with the intention of creating a supportive HH atmosphere and behaviour change at the HH level. CNWs also made home visits to beneficiaries twice a month to follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up on topics discussed during group sessions and to discuss specific concerns that mothers had.Duration of intervention period: 24 months, May 2012 to April 2014Frequency: monthly transfers; on second week of each month; BCC: main activity was weeklyNumber of study contacts: 3: baseline (2012), midline (2013), endline (2014)Providers: designed and evaluated by the IFPRI and implemented by the United Nations' WFP. WFP managed the procurement and delivery of transfers, as well as the nutrition BCC training, and routinely monitored the programme. An NGO contracted by WFP, the ESDO, was responsible for the field implementation of project activities, including distributing the monthly food and cash transfers, and delivering the nutrition BCC (Ahmed 2019 b)Delivery: cash delivered using a mobile phone cash transfer system, in which women collected cash from designated distribution sites using mobile verification of identity. While attendance at these BCC sessions was a condition for receipt of transfers, this was a 'soft' condition. When a mother missed a session, the CNW followed up with a home visit to ascertain why the session had been missed, and there were no cases where a beneficiary was dropped from the study for failing to attend sessions. In addition, CNWs staff conducted community meetings and met with influential members (village leaders, imams, elders) of the villages in which the BCC took place to explain the purposes of the nutrition training and to provide them with the information being conveyed to study participants. CNWs received training prior to the start of the intervention. In localities where the same payment point was used for both the cash group and the cash + BCC group, cash beneficiaries were paid in the morning while cash + BCC beneficiaries were paid in the afternoon to minimise the likelihood of information from the BCC activities spilling over to the cash treatment group. Both quantitative and qualitative data collected throughout the intervention indicated that implementation fidelity was high.Co\u00e2\u0080\u0090interventions: NRResource requirements: NREconomic indicators: USD 19 per month + BCC activities cost approximately USD 50 per year per beneficiaryFood onlyFood access intervention category: N/AIntervention type: food provisionDescription: consisted of a monthly food ration of 30 kg of rice, 2 kg of mosoor pulse (a type of lentil), and 2 L of micronutrient\u00e2\u0080\u0090fortified cooking oil.

The BCC intervention involved 3 complementary activities: 1. weekly group BCC trainings \u00e2\u0080\u0093 some with beneficiaries only (i.e. the target women in the Food+BCC or Cash+BCC groups) and some that invited other family members to attend along with beneficiaries, 2. twice\u00e2\u0080\u0090a\u00e2\u0080\u0090month visits by CNWs to the beneficiaries' homes, and 3 monthly group meetings between programme staff and influential community leaders.

We noted that 1 might be concerned that BCC could lead to social desirability bias affecting the IYCDDS responses \u00e2\u0080\u0093 i.e. after 2 years of nutrition training, mothers might respond to questions about child feeding by over\u00e2\u0080\u0090reporting foods commonly discussed during the group training sessions. The fact that there are differences between what mothers in the North described and what mothers in the South described \u00e2\u0080\u0093 e.g. that mothers receiving BCC in the South did not report feeding their children dairy products more frequently than those in the control group \u00e2\u0080\u0093 despite their receiving identical BCC gave us some confidence in these results. TABLE: Alaofe 2016 TABLE: Study characteristics\t \tMethods\tStudy design: PCSHow were missing data handled? in 2008, enumerators repeated surveys with each woman in the agricultural groups who had been interviewed the year before, if possible. For the village sample, enumerators returned to previously sampled HHs and interviewed the same respondent, wherever possible.

Most common reason was that mothers/carers were working on their land or moved/travelled out of village on day of data collection. In addition, some blood samples were unsuitable for further processing: 5.74% due to haemolysis, 0.47% were specimens without proper requisition slips and 3.23% had insufficient sample quantity.Description of subgroups measured and reported: intervention villages: WG: HHs with women who participated in a local women's agricultural group and NWG: HHs where none of the women belonged to a women's agricultural group.

NR (only available survey data used)Randomisation ratio: N/ARecruitment method: ration cards issued to individuals or families based on their poverty status, and purchased from the PDS. In Odisha state, the KBK region, comprising 8 districts, has universal PDS access; whereas it was a targeted programme in the 22 non\u00e2\u0080\u0090KBK districts.Sample size justification and outcome used: no sample size calculation. National\u00e2\u0080\u0090level surveys carried out to be nationally representative of consumer expenditure; conducted by the National Sample Survey Organization.Sampling method: purposive programme placement by government as the decision to make PDS a universal programme in the KBK region based upon its history of poor nutritional outcome. Hence, the selection of districts into the programme was not random. Sample was restricted to rural areas of Odisha since the PDS revival was more effective in rural areas. KBK region \u00e2\u0080\u0093 with a universal PDS \u00e2\u0080\u0093 was the treatment group while the rest of Odisha was the control group. Non\u00e2\u0080\u0090KBK districts within the same states were control group. For further robustness checks, samples restricted to the KBK districts and considered HHs without any ration card as the alternative control group, with all other HHs with a ration card (AAY/BPL/APL) as the treatment group.Study aim or objective: to determine the role of consumer food subsidies in improving nutritional intake and diet quality by evaluating the expansion of the government food assistance programme coverage in the hunger prone state of Odisha in India.Study period: about 8 years. 2004\u00e2\u0080\u00932005 survey was baseline and the 2011\u00e2\u0080\u00932012 survey was postintervention informationUnit of allocation or exposure: cluster: districts 8 KBK districts with universal PDS (treatment) vs 22 non\u00e2\u0080\u0090KBK districts (control).

Hence, the selection of districts into the program (here, PDS) is not random. We do a slew of robustness check to ensure that we control for this later in the paper.\" \"Results from the DID regressions are presented in Table 6. Estimates as reported in column (1) were arrived at by controlling for the district fixed effects but not for the HH characteristics. In the column (2), both district fixed effects and the HH characteristics were controlled for.\"\t \tBaseline outcome measurements similar (Selection bias)\tLow risk\tOutcome variables related to macronutrient intake and sources of calories were all significantly higher in the control group: calories; protein; fat as well as calories from cereals; non\u00e2\u0080\u0090cereals; pulses; egg, fish and meat; dairy products; vegetables and fruits and edible oil all P < 0.01. However, PSM was performed to account for the non\u00e2\u0080\u0090random allocation of the intervention and control: there were no significant group differences for the covariates used to perform the PSM.\t \tBlinding of participants and personnel (Performance bias)\tLow risk\tParticipants were not blinded to allocation as their subsidy status was determined by their residential district; however, it is unlikely that they would have known that the national survey (from which the data were obtained) would be comparing their nutritional intake with participants receiving another intervention. Implementation of the project by local state government seems totally separate from implementation of the surveys by the respective organisation.\t \tBlinding of outcome assessment (Detection bias)\tHigh risk\tIt is NR whether outcomes were assessed blindly. Outcomes were assessed by self\u00e2\u0080\u0090reported measures.\t \tProtection against contamination (Performance bias)\tLow risk\tAs intervention and control treatments were government\u00e2\u0080\u0090assigned according to state district, it is unlikely that meaningful contamination could have occurred. Any small spillover effect at the border between the 2 areas would be diluted by the large sample sizes and geographical area. NR, but although it is controlled who could and could not buy the rice (ration card), it did not control who actually used it.\t \tIncomplete outcome data (Attrition bias)\tHigh risk\tVery little information provided about attrition, but 3819 HHs were surveyed at baseline and 2973 at follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up, indicating a 87.8% 'response rate'. According to the supplementary data sheet, difference\u00e2\u0080\u0090in\u00e2\u0080\u0090difference estimates were performed on 6722 observations; roughly the sum of available baseline and follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up data. Therefore, it would appear that missing values were not adjusted for or imputed.\t \tSelective outcome reporting (Reporting bias)\tUnclear risk\tNo protocol available and the paper did not follow the usual journal format with a designated Methods section. The aim of the study was to assess unspecified 'nutrient intake indicators' as well as a variety of food items in the diet, according to 6 groups. The latter have all been reported on.\t \tOther bias\tLow risk\tSelection bias was overcome by correction for HH variables. Since we were testing for the significance of a large number of dependent variables, it might lead to higher probability of Type I errors leading to false rejection of the null hypothesis. To control for this bias, we used the summary indices approach of Clingingsmith et al. (2009) and Kling et al. (2004).

It is also unclear who the control groups were so it is difficult to assess potential contamination.\t \tIncomplete outcome data (Attrition bias)\tHigh risk\tAttrition was relatively high for the total follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up period; with higher attrition in the intervention compared to the control group (31.4% with intervention vs 25.5% with control). Although reasons for attrition were unrelated to treatment, the characteristics of those who were LTFU and those who remained in the study differed significantly, and the characteristics of people who were LTFU in the intervention and control group were also different.\t \tSelective outcome reporting (Reporting bias)\tUnclear risk\tWe could access the protocol. In the report of Rabbani et al 2006, some outcomes that are NR in the article were listed such as schooling, purpose of cash borrowing, legal awareness, social inclusion and Eid spending. Note: minor differences in baseline values between Asadullah and Rabbani.\t \tOther bias\tLow risk\tNone identified. TABLE: Asfaw 2014 TABLE: Study characteristics\t \tMethods\tStudy design: cRCTStudy grouping: parallel groupHow were missing data handled: data from HHs that were LTFU were excluded from the analysis (Ward 2010). For the HH spending study, a further 45 HHs were excluded due to very large values for total adjusted expenditure as well as missing values (The Kenya CT\u00e2\u0080\u0090OVC team 2012).Randomisation ratio: 1:1Recruitment method: NRSample size justification and outcome used: NRSampling method: within 7 districts, 4 locations (clusters) were selected randomly after excluding those with particularly low poverty rates or an inadequate capacity to supply the relevant health and education services, or large existing orphans and vulnerable children support programmes. List of eligible HHs was compiled in the intervention locations according to standard programme operation guidelines. In control districts, programme targeting was 'simulated' in order to identify a sample of HHs that were comparable to eligible HHs in intervention areas.Study aim or objective: 1. to determine if the Kenya CT\u00e2\u0080\u0090OVC led to an increase in investment in agricultural and non\u00e2\u0080\u0090agricultural productive assets and activities; increased food consumption obtained from own production; resulted in a shift in adult labour towards own agricultural and non\u00e2\u0080\u0090agricultural activities and away from casual labour; resulted in heterogeneous impact by gender; and reduced the time children spend at work. 2. to investigate whether the CT\u00e2\u0080\u0090OVC had changed the preferences of HHs in terms of their consumption behaviour.Study period: 4 years (March\u00e2\u0080\u0093August 2007 to May\u00e2\u0080\u0093July 2011)Unit of allocation or exposure: location within eligible district\t \tParticipants\tBaseline characteristicsOverall (n = 1783)Age: head of HH (years): 55.97Place of residence: NRSex: proportion female\u00e2\u0080\u0090headed HHs: 0.64Ethnicity and language: Swahili, Luo and SomaliOccupation: salaried employment: 0.04; casual labour: 0.57; self\u00e2\u0080\u0090employed: 0.32Education (years): HH head: 3.37; spouse: 1.25SES: HH size: 5.62; proportion of elderly headed HHs: 0.42; number of orphaned or vulnerable children in the HH: 2.47; total cultivable land: 1.95 hectares; proportion of livestock owners: 0.76; HH expenditure per capita per month (n = 1783): KES 1285.98Social capital: NRNutritional status: NRMorbidities: proportion of HHs where head of HH was ill: 0.02Concomitant or previous care: NRIntervention or exposure group (n = 1265)Age: HH head (years): 58.53; number of HH members aged < 11 years: 1.97; number of HH members aged 12\u00e2\u0080\u009317 years: 1.31Place of residence: proportion of communities far away from local market: 0.21Sex: proportion female\u00e2\u0080\u0090headed HHs: 0.65Ethnicity and language: Swahili, Luo and SomaliOccupation: proportion of individuals unemployed 0.64, in wage labour 0.01, casual work 0.09, off farm work 0.03Education (years): HH head: 2.99; spouse: 1.10SES: AE total expenditure: KES 1441.89; AE monthly housing expenditure: KES 34.51; share of total expenditure spent on housing: 0.025; HH size: 5.55; proportion of HHs with transfers as main income: 0.07; monthly HH consumption (per capita): KES 1298.09; total cultivable land: 1.70 hectares; proportion of livestock owners (n = 1265): 0.75Social capital: NRNutritional status: AE monthly expenditure per food group (KES): cereals 266.23, tubers 53.06, meat fish 119.28, dairy 47.68, fruit vegetables 186.04, other food 167.42, eating out 9.32; HDDS 7\u00e2\u0080\u0090day: 5.225; proportion of children aged < 5 years who were: stunted 0.415, underweight 0.206, wasted 0.06.

Intervention HHs were also less likely to use unprotected water sources, have various HH assets, but more HHs in which agriculture was the main source of income and less in which salaried employment was the main source of income. Intervention communities had more access to a road to the village and less distance to the local market, but a lower share of HHs which could make telephone calls. Intervention individuals were significantly older and more likely to be disabled, unemployed or in casual work; and had lower levels of education. For the HH spending paper (Kenya CT\u00e2\u0080\u0090OVC 2012): intervention HHs expended significantly more of their monthly budget on tubers.Attrition per relevant group: at 24 months (Asfaw 2014): intervention group: 231/1542 (15%); control group: 184/571 (24.4%). Attrition by district (intervention clusters vs control clusters) Garissa (11.6% vs 31.6%); Homabay (14% vs 21.1%); Kisumu (15% vs 25.3%); Kwale (13.2% vs 16.1%); Migori (16.3% vs 18.7%); Nairobi 16.9% vs 47.6%); Suba (10.9% vs 20.8%) (Ward 2010). Study authors reported that the loss of HHs was partly due to postelection violence. At 48 months (Asfaw 2014): intervention group: 262/1542 (16.9%); control group: 224/755 (29.7%). The HH spending paper reported only total attrition, i.e. 16.9% (387/2294). Further post\u00e2\u0080\u0090hoc exclusion of 45 HHs due to large values for total adjusted expenditure and missing values leads to a total 'attrition' of 18.8%.Description of subgroups measured and reported: HH size 5 vs \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 5; female\u00e2\u0080\u0090headed vs male\u00e2\u0080\u0090headed HHsTotal number completed and analysed per relevant group: in the HH spending paper (Kenya CT\u00e2\u0080\u0090OVC 2012) 1907 HHs completed baseline and 2\u00e2\u0080\u0090year (2009) follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up, but only 1862 HHs were analysed due to post\u00e2\u0080\u0090hoc exclusions. In the food consumption paper (Asfaw et al 2014), 1280 intervention and 531 control HHs completed baseline and 4\u00e2\u0080\u0090year (2011) follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up, but only 1265 intervention and 518 control HHs were included.Total number enrolled per relevant group: intervention group: 1542 HHs; control group: 755 HHsTotal number randomised per relevant group: 4 locations within each of 7 districts randomised to either the intervention or control group. Intervention group: 14 locations (clusters); control group: 14 locations (clusters)\t \tInterventions\tIntervention: UCTFood access intervention category: increase buying powerDescription: KES 1500 (about USD 21) per month, irrespective of HH size. HHs in some districts were expected to meet certain conditions, which were intended to ensure that children received proper care. HHs were penalised with deductions from the subsequent payment for infringements.Duration of intervention period: 2007\u00e2\u0080\u00932011Frequency: every 2 months (lump sum equalling 2 months' transfer amount)Number of study contacts: baseline (2007) and follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up at 2009 (HH spending) or 2011 (food consumption)Providers: government of KenyaDelivery: payments made through post officesCo\u00e2\u0080\u0090interventions: NRResource requirements: post office staff for the processing of transfers, and government as well as development partner staff for administrative and monitoring requirements.Economic indicators: in 3 financial years (2006\u00e2\u0080\u00932009) the programme spent KES 776.7 million. Of this, KES 383.3 million was spent on HHs; with the balance spent on operational costs, but administrative costs are said to be declining proportionally each year. In 2010, the cost of supporting a single HH for a year was KES 36,978 (transfer included).Control: no intervention\t \tOutcomes\tProportion of HH expenditure on food: total monthly consumption expenditure (per AE); proportion of HH monthly consumption expenditure on food; total monthly food expenditure (cereals, tubers, meat/fish, dairy, fruit/vegetables, other food, food eaten out)Dietary diversity: DDS; proportion of HHs that consumed individual food groups (e.g. cereal, fruit, etc.) in the preceding 7 daysAnthropometry: HAZ; WAZ; WHZ; stunting; underweight; wastingMorbidity: number of children with reported symptoms of upper respiratory illness\t \tIdentification\tSponsorship source: UK DfID; US National Institute of Mental Health; Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and DevelopmentCountry: KenyaSetting: ultra\u00e2\u0080\u0090poor HHs in rural areas with high prevalence of HIV/AIDSAuthors' names: Solomon Asfaw; Tia Palermo; Patrick WardEmail: solomon.asfaw@fao.org; tiampalermo@gmail.com; patrick.ward@opml.co.ukDeclarations of interest: noStudy or programme name and acronym: Kenya CT\u00e2\u0080\u0090OVC (Cash Transfer Programme for Orphans and Vulnerable Children)Type of record: journal articles, operational and impact evaluation reportTrial registration: none reportedProtocol availability: no\t \tNotes\tPopulation: AE: children aged < 15 years were considered as 0.75 of an adult; children aged \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 15 years were considered a full adult.\t \tRisk of bias\t \tBias\tAuthors' judgement\tSupport for judgement\t \tRandom sequence generation (Selection bias)\tUnclear risk\tAuthors mentioned random selection of intervention and control locations within 7 districts, but did not report how the random sequence was generated.\t \tAllocation concealment (Selection bias)\tUnclear risk\tNo information provided on how the locations within districts were randomised; or how this randomisation sequence was protected.\t \tBaseline characteristics similar (Selection bias)\tLow risk\tBaseline differences reported between groups. The heads of treatment HHs were older (P \u00e2\u0089\u00a4 0.01), more likely to be male (P < 0.05) and to have less education (P < 0.01) than those in control HHs. Intervention HHs also had significantly fewer assets (99% CI). The proportion of control HHs that had agriculture as the main source of income was significantly lower (90% CI). The 24\u00e2\u0080\u0090month analyses adjusted for baseline HH demographic composition (Kenya CT\u00e2\u0080\u0090OVC team 2012), whereas the analysis after 4 years used estimated propensity scores to account for these baseline differences (Asfaw 2014).\t \tBaseline outcome measurements similar (Selection bias)\tLow risk\tNo baseline non\u00e2\u0080\u0090equivalence was detected for the HH spending (Kenya CT\u00e2\u0080\u0090OVC 2012) paper; with the exception of proportion AE monthly expenditure for tubers which was significantly higher in the intervention group (P = 0.005). Outcomes such as HH expenditure on food and proportion of children with underweight or stunting, or both (< \u00e2\u0080\u00932SD z\u00e2\u0080\u0090scores) were similar between the groups. There was no baseline non\u00e2\u0080\u0090equivalence for the HH spending paper; with the exception of proportion AE monthly expenditure for tubers, which was significantly higher in the intervention group (P = 0.005). All outcomes for the food consumption paper were NR for the baseline survey.\t \tBlinding of participants and personnel (Performance bias)\tLow risk\tGiven the way in which the intervention was rolled out, it is not possible for participants to be blinded.

Measurement bias: unlikely. Incorrect analysis: unlikely. Recruitment bias: high risk. Clusters were assigned before recruitment of HHs; which may have lead to a bias in participation, especially for control HHs. Other bias: the introduction of punitive conditionalities in some intervention clusters, but not others, may have lead to bias in attrition or bias in outcome measurement. TABLE: Baird 2013 TABLE: Study characteristics\t \tMethods\tStudy design: cRCTHow were missing data handled: for the analysis of the postintervention follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up data, the study authors stated: \"We conducted all analysis among those who were successfully interviewed in Round 4, which maximises sample size for the estimation of longer\u00e2\u0080\u0090term impacts.\"Randomisation ratio: 1:1Recruitment method: after the random selection of EAs and individuals into the treatment group, the local NGO implemented the cash transfers held meetings in each treatment EA between December 2007 and January 2008 to invite the selected individuals into the programme. At these meetings, the programme beneficiary and her parents/guardians were offered the monthly transfer amounts. This consisted of a transfer to the parents, a transfer directly to the girl and payment of school fees for girls attending secondary school. Transfer amounts to parents were varied randomly across EAs at USD 4, USD 6, USD 8 and USD 10 per month, so that each parent within an EA received the same offer. Within each EA, there was a lottery to determine the transfer amount to the programme beneficiaries, which was USD 1, USD 2, USD 3, USD 4 or USD 5 per month. The lottery was held publicly to ensure that the process was transparent. Secondary school fees were paid in full directly to schools.Sample size justification and outcome used: NRSampling method: stratified random sampling. Zomba district contains 550 EAs (Zomba city 50; rural traditional authorities 500). 176 EAs were selected from 3 different geographical strata: urban (Zomba city, 29 EAs), near rural (16 km from Zomba city, 119 EAs) and far rural (\u00e2\u0089\u00a5 16 km from Zomba city, 28 EAs). Of the 50 EAs in Zomba city, 21 were excluded on the basis of advice from local experts who deemed these areas too affluent for the proposed intervention. In each of the 2 rural strata, with the exception of 1 TA that was unsafe for field work, the study EAs were randomly selected. In the 176 sampled EAs, each dwelling was visited to take a census of all never\u00e2\u0080\u0090married girls aged 13\u00e2\u0080\u009322 years (sample frame). Girls were grouped according to those enrolled in school at baseline (baseline schoolgirls), or those not enrolled in school at baseline (baseline dropouts). In the cohort of baseline schoolgirls, a subset of eligible girls was randomly selected for the study. The sampling percentages for this cohort differed by geographical stratum and age group and was 14\u00e2\u0080\u009345% in urban areas and 70\u00e2\u0080\u0093100% in rural areas. All the girls who were not enrolled in school at baseline (baseline dropouts) were sampled to participate in the study This sampling procedure yielded a baseline study sample of 4051 girls of whom 3796 (94%) were enrolled and completed a baseline interview at the end of 2007. Of these, 889 were baseline dropouts and 2907 were baseline schoolgirls.Study aim or objective: to examine whether a cash transfer programme targeted at adolescent girls in Malawi helped empower its recipients in the short\u00e2\u0080\u0090run, i.e. during and immediately after the 2\u00e2\u0080\u0090year intervention.Study period: 2007\u00e2\u0080\u00932012Unit of allocation or exposure: females aged 13\u00e2\u0080\u009322 years\t \tParticipants\tBaseline characteristicsOverall group (n = 2706): NRIntervention or exposure group (n = 1211)Age (years): baseline school girls, means: CCT group 14.9 (SD 1.8); UCT group 15.4 (SD 1.9); girls not attending school at baseline: 16.8 (SD 2.4)Place of residence: urban HH, means: baseline school girls: CCT group 0.478 (SD 0.5); UCT group 0.418 (SD 0.494); girls not attending school at baseline: 0.129 (SD 0.335)Sex: female\u00e2\u0080\u0090headed HH: baseline school girls, n (%): CCT group 63 (26); UCT group 78 (24); girls not attending school at baseline, n (%): 90 (39)Ethnicity and language: NROccupation: N/AEducation: highest grade attended: baseline school girls, means: CCT group 7.1 (SD 1.7); UCT group 7.9 (SD 1.6); girls not attending school at baseline, means: 5.8 (SD 2.9)SES: HH size: baseline school girls, means: CCT group 6.341 (SD 2.1); UCT group 6.7 (SD 2.1); Girls not attending school at baseline, means: 6.1 (SD 2.6); electricity in dwelling: baseline school girls, n (%): CCT group 31 (28); UCT group 49 (24); girls not attending school at baseline, n (%): 24 (11); piped water in dwelling: baseline school girls, n (%): CCT group 48 (41); UCT group 135 (60); Girls not attending school at baseline, n (%): 63 (25)Social capital: NRNutritional status: NRMorbidities: NRConcomitant or previous care: NRControl group (n = 1495)Age: years: Baseline school girls, means: 15.3 (SD 1.9); girls not attending school at baseline: 17.6 (SD 2.2)Place of residence: urban HH, means: Baseline school girls: 0.35 (SD 0.48); girls not attending school at baseline: 0.18 (SD 0.39)Sex: female\u00e2\u0080\u0090headed HH: baseline school girls, n (%): 275 (32); girls not attending school at baseline, n (%): 93 (42)Ethnicity and language: NROccupation: N/AEducation: highest grade attended: baseline school girls, means: 7.6 (SD 1.6); girls not attending school at baseline, means: 6.2 (SD 2.9)SES: HH size: baseline school girls, means: 6.375 (SD 2.262); girls not attending school at baseline, means: 6.12 (SD 2.388); electricity in dwelling: baseline school girls, n (%): 86 (20); girls not attending school at baseline, n (%): 16 (7); piped water in dwelling: Baseline school girls, n (%): 277 (47); girls not attending school at baseline, n (%): 64 (29)Social capital: NRNutritional status: NRMorbidities: NRConcomitant or previous care: NRInclusion criteria: never\u00e2\u0080\u0090married girls aged 13\u00e2\u0080\u009322 years enrolled in school at baseline (baseline schoolgirls), and those not enrolled in school at baseline (baseline dropouts) in selected 176 EAs.Exclusion criteria: NRBaseline imbalance: in the girls who attended school at baseline, those in the CCT group were younger than those in the UCT group, and, therefore, also a lower grade attained.Attrition per relevant group: reported at postintervention follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up (2 years after intervention): baseline school girls: control group: 10.7%; intervention group: NR.

TABLE: Beegle 2017 TABLE: Study characteristics\t \tMethods\tStudy design: cRCTStudy grouping: parallel groupHow were missing data handled? NRRandomisation ratio: 1:1:1:1:1 (according to table 1)Recruitment method: village headmen together with the village committees select HHs to participate. Specific recruitment methods NRSample size justification and outcome used: NRSampling method: sampling for the trial: of 28 districts with the PWP programme, 12 districts randomly sampled, stratified by geographic region. Of these 12 districts, 182 villages (EAs) that had been sampled for the national survey in 2010\u00e2\u0080\u00932011 AND preselected for PWP were selected. These were then randomised to the treatment groups. Villages in the sampling frame were randomly assigned to 1 of 5 groups. Group 0 was control group of villages that were not included in PWP programme in 2012\u00e2\u0080\u00932013 Season. Groups 1\u00e2\u0080\u00934 participated in the PWP in the planting season (cycle 1 of PWP). These 4 groups varied in terms of timing of the second cycle of programme and the schedule of payments in both cycles. At HH level: they choose 10 HHs from the 16 survey HHs in the village to be offered the programme. Sampling for MSFA programme covered all districts of Malawi through a 2\u00e2\u0080\u0090stage targeting approach. In the first stage, there was pro\u00e2\u0080\u0090poor geographic targeting and in the second there was a combination of community\u00e2\u0080\u0090based targeting and self\u00e2\u0080\u0090selection of beneficiaries. The amount of funds given to a district was proportional to the district's population and to the poverty rates as well as other measures of vulnerability. District officials then targeted a subset of EPAs based on poverty and vulnerability criteria. Traditional authorities in the EPAs then allocated funds to a subset of selected GVH who each oversaw 3\u00e2\u0080\u009310 villages. The GVH determined how many HHs participated in each village based on available funding; the GVH then worked with the village committees in each village to select participating HHs.Study aim or objective: to determine the impact of these programmes by estimating the effect of Malawi's large\u00e2\u0080\u0090scale PWP, which operates under the MSAF to improve food security and increase the use of fertiliser and other agricultural inputs. The MASAF PWP has been operational since mid\u00e2\u0080\u00901990s and aimed to provide short\u00e2\u0080\u0090term labour\u00e2\u0080\u0090intensive activities to poor, able\u00e2\u0080\u0090bodied HHs for the purpose of enhancing their food security, mainly through increased access to farm inputs during the planting period. Programme was designed to be interlinked with Malawi's large\u00e2\u0080\u0090scale FISP through the implementation of the PWP in the planting months of the main agricultural season when the FISP distribution also occurs. The premise behind this is that the PWP facilitates poor, credit\u00e2\u0080\u0090constrained HHs to access subsidised fertiliser.Study period: baseline: 2010\u00e2\u0080\u00932011 (based on data collected during the national integrated HH survey.

For the former, analyses are based on round 1 of data collection, when interventions had not started in all but 3 villages but knowledge of PWP implementation existed and could have influenced behaviour. For the latter, they explored the balance between treatment and control villages in terms of pretreatment covariates and outcomes, they used the IHS3 data from 2010\u00e2\u0080\u00932011. Using the first round of follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up data, they found that HHs in the non\u00e2\u0080\u0090IHS3 sample were better off than the IHS3 sample, with better educated HH heads, smaller HH sizes and fewer children aged < 14. However, there was imbalance in preprogramme food security at both the village and HH levels in the 159 villages for which IHS3 data were available. The IHS sample was well balanced for a range of non food\u00e2\u0080\u0090security outcomes.Attrition per relevant group: NRDescription of subgroups measured and reported: effects by geographic regionTotal number completed and analysed per relevant group: NR: only total number of observations reported.Total number enrolled per relevant group: 10 HHs in each village offered the programmeTotal number randomised per relevant group: group 0 (control): 38 communities; group 1 (cycle 1: planting season, cycle 2: harvest season; lump sum): 40 communities; group 2 (cycle 1: planting season, cycle 2: harvest season; split payment): 34 communities; group 3 (cycle 1: planting season, cycle 2: lean season; lump sum): 35 communities; group 4 (cycle 1: planting season, cycle 2: lean season; split payment): 35 communities.\t \tInterventions\tIntervention characteristicsIntervention or exposureFood access intervention category: income generationIntervention type: PWPDescription: MASAF PWP has been operational since mid\u00e2\u0080\u00901990s and aims to provide short\u00e2\u0080\u0090term labour\u00e2\u0080\u0090intensive activities to poor, able\u00e2\u0080\u0090bodied HHs for the purpose of enhancing their food security, mainly through increased access to farm inputs during planting period. Programme was designed to be interlinked with Malawi's FISP through implementation of PWP in planting months of the main agricultural season when the FISP distribution also occurs. The premise was that the PWP facilitates poor, credit\u00e2\u0080\u0090constrained HHs to access subsidised fertiliser. Projects were mostly road rehabilitation or construction, with some forestation and irrigation projects. Wage rate was MWK 300/day (USD 0.92/day) for a total payment of MWK 3600 for a 12\u00e2\u0080\u0090day wave. Cycle 1 of PWP was implemented during planting season (October\u00e2\u0080\u0093December) to align with the timing of the distribution of FISP. Cycle 2 of PWP was designed to take place after harvest in June and July.Duration of intervention period: November\u00e2\u0080\u0093December 2012 to November 2013 (1 year)Frequency: group 1: 4 payments in total (2 in cycle 1, 2 in cycle 2). Group 3: similar to group 1 only timing was different. Group 2 and 4: each payment in cycle 2 was split into 5 payments (so 12 payments in total). In 2012, as a response to a large currency devaluation, the programme was doubled in size and scaled up to cover about 500,000 HHs per year. Duration of project participation increased from 12 days to 48 days, split into 2 cycles of 24 days each; the cycles were further divided into 2 consecutive 12\u00e2\u0080\u0090day waves, and payments were generally made within 1 or 2 weeks of the end of each wave.\"Number of study contacts: data came from 5 rounds of panel HH survey data. Basis for panel was the IHS3 fielded in 2010\u00e2\u0080\u00932011 by Malawi's National Statistics Office. The 16 IHS3 HHs were interviewed in 4 additional rounds: before the public works projects started during planting season (November 2012) after the first cycle, preharvest (February 2013), after the lean season cycle, postharvest (April\u00e2\u0080\u0093May 2013) and finally after the completion of the 2012\u00e2\u0080\u00932013 season (November 2013).Providers: MASAF PWP is a government programme but the study was implemented by research team. Payments in the study districts were facilitated by the research team for the purposes of the evaluation. This was intended to ensure that payments were made without delay, on specific schedules. Administrative payment records confirmed that there were no differences in time lag between work and payment across the districts.Delivery: groups 1\u00e2\u0080\u00934 participated in the PWP in the planting season (cycle 1 of PWP). These 4 groups varied in terms of timing of the second cycle of the programme and the schedule of payments in both cycles. However, the analysis grouped all these intervention groups into 1 to assess overall effect of having a PWP programme in place. Payments in the study districts were facilitated by the research team for the evaluation. This was intended to ensure that payments were made without delay, on specific schedules. Administrative payment records confirmed that there were no differences in time lag between work and payment across the districts. In addition to the HH survey data, in terms of monitoring the intervention, administrative records included the dates and amounts of payments and the identities of recipients. These were used to confirm that beneficiaries received payments in accordance with the days they worked. Payments in the study districts were facilitated by the research team for the purposes of the evaluation, with physical delivery of the cash in conjunction with the district officials. The split\u00e2\u0080\u0090payment variant slightly increased the cost of implementation. Epayments, which would entail a small marginal cost of delivery, were under consideration for future rounds of PWP.Co\u00e2\u0080\u0090interventions: in 3 study districts, fertiliser subsidy coupon distribution took place between the first and second 12\u00e2\u0080\u0090day waves of PWP activities, and, in the remaining 9 districts, fertiliser coupon distribution overlapped with PWP work and payment. The national fertiliser subsidy programme provided about half of HHs in the country with coupons that allowed 2 bags of fertiliser to be purchased for MWK 500 each. However, fertiliser coupons were more likely to be available to treated HHs in accordance with the designed linkage between PWP and the national fertiliser subsidy scheme.Resource requirements: NREconomic indicators: wage rate was MWK 300/day (USD 0.92/day) for a total payment of MWK 3600 for a 12\u00e2\u0080\u0090day wave. The split\u00e2\u0080\u0090payment variant slightly increased the cost of implementation.Control: no intervention\t \tOutcomes\tFood security: Food Security Score; Resilience Index; Principal Components Analysis IndexDietary diversity: FCS; number of food groups consumed in the last week for 7 main groupsDietary intake: log per capita food consumption for the last week; per AE calories of the food consumed\t \tIdentification\tSponsorship source: World Bank Research Committee, Knowledge for Change programme and GLM\u00e2\u0080\u0090LIC (grant number C2\u00e2\u0080\u0090RA2\u00e2\u0080\u0090211).Country: MalawiSetting: poor and able\u00e2\u0080\u0090bodied HHs in 3 regions of MalawiAuthor's name: Kathleen BeegleEmail: kbeegle@worldbank.org (K Beegle); egalasso@worldbank.org (E Galasso); goldberg@econ.umd.edu (J Goldberg).Declarations of interest: NRStudy or programme name and acronym: MASAF PWP (Malawi Social Action Fund's Public Works Programme)Type of record: journal article\t \tNotes\t\u00c2\u00a0\t \tRisk of bias\t \tBias\tAuthors' judgement\tSupport for judgement\t \tRandom sequence generation (Selection bias)\tLow risk\tQuote: \"Villages were randomly assigned (by computer) to one of the four treatment groups or a control condition; households within treatment villages were randomly selected to be offered the program.\"\t \tAllocation concealment (Selection bias)\tLow risk\tAllocation to treatment group was done at village level.Quote: \"Villages were randomly assigned (by computer) to one of the four treatment groups or a control condition; households within treatment villages were randomly selected to be offered the program.\"\t \tBaseline characteristics similar (Selection bias)\tHigh risk\tAllocation to treatment group was done at village level.Quote: \"Villages were randomly assigned (by computer) to one of the four treatment groups or a control condition; households within treatment villages were randomly selected to be offered the program.\"\t \tBaseline outcome measurements similar (Selection bias)\tHigh risk\tEven though randomisation was conducted by computer, there was imbalance in preprogramme food security at both the village and HH levels in the 159 villages for which IHS3 data were available.

TABLE: Breisinger 2018 TABLE: Study characteristics\t \tMethods\tStudy design: controlled trial (using regression discontinuity for allocation)How were missing data handled? It is assumed that missing data were excluded. The intended sample for the Takaful and Karama analysis components consisted of 7996 HHs. Of these, 1144 HHs could not be located based on the address data in the registration form. An additional 261 HHs were visited but no HH members could be located, and 70 HHs were not surveyed due to other reasons including declining to participate in the survey, no capable respondent being identified, being part of another HH already in the sample or the registrant having died. Considering only HHs for which there was no error in the location information, the overall response rate was 95.2%.Randomisation ratio: N/ARecruitment method: see sampling methodology. Sampled HHs were visited by an interviewer.Sample size justification and outcome used: outcome used NR. Justification: based on power calculations that the evaluation team conducted to determine the sample size required for the TKP impact evaluation, the study required 8016 HHs spread across 501 clusters (villages), with 16 HHs per cluster. Authors purposefully selected more than the 16 HHs per cluster knowing that there was a risk of being unable to locate all the HHs in the registrant sample.Sampling method: targeting for programme: to avoid inefficient targeting, the programme combined geographical targeting with a PMT mechanism. With respect to the geographical targeting, the programme was first launched in the poorest districts within the poorest governorates in Egypt. The PMT was used to identify the poor within the selected districts, based on selection criteria and a set cutoff score, based on the poverty line derived from Egypt's HH Income, Expenditure and Consumption Survey for 2012\u00e2\u0080\u00932013. In addition to the PMT, both Takaful and Karama have other categorical selection criteria; Takaful requires that beneficiaries have children and Karama requires that beneficiaries be elderly or disabled (or both), or (added later) orphaned. PMT formula varies by region but the threshold is the same across all regions. Over time, since the programme started and across the 4 enrolment waves, the threshold has been changed. Sampling for the impact evaluation survey: \"The sampling strategy for the TKP Impact evaluation was designed to provide a representative sample of Takaful and Karama HHs with Proxy Means Test scores near the thresholds for an RD [regression discontinuity] approach to impact analysis. Stratification for the sample selection was based primarily on region. For the Upper Rural region of Egypt, they stratified by governorate (9 governorates in Upper Rural). As such, they defined 14 strata: 5 for each region excluding Upper Rural and 9 strata for Upper Rural. They sampled VCs within the 14 region\u00e2\u0080\u0090governorate strata using simple random sampling, where the number of clusters per stratum was proportional to the share of registrants in each stratum, and restricted selection to clusters in which there was a sufficient number of registrants near the threshold. The clusters were defined as Takaful\u00e2\u0080\u0090only clusters (325) or mixed Takaful and Karama clusters (75). Within each village, 20 HHs were randomly selected for inclusion in the survey if they were within 600 points of the current Takaful threshold score of 4500 or 200 points of the Karama threshold of 7203. On average, they selected 10 eligible and 10 ineligible HHs, and for Takaful HHs, they weighted the probability of selection such that HHs within 200 points of the current threshold of 4500 were 2.5 times more likely, and HHs within 200\u00e2\u0080\u0093400 points of the cutoff were 1.5 times more likely to be selected than those that were 400\u00e2\u0080\u0093600 points from the cutoff. They selected more HHs than the 16 HHs per cluster that the power calculations suggested would be necessary, knowing that there was a risk of not being able to locate all the HHs in the registrant sample.Study aim or objective: objective of programme: Takaful and Karama is a conditional 5 cash transfer programme that seeks to provide income support to poor families with children (under 18 years of age), poor elderly (aged \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 65 years) and people with severe disability. Objective of impact evaluation: to provide rigorous evidence on the impacts of the programme on HH consumption, poverty and other measures of well\u00e2\u0080\u0090being including child education, health and food security, and the prevalence of overweight and obesity in adult women.Study period: approximately 28 months. Programme start: March 2015; impact evaluation survey: 15 July to 30 August 2017. Takaful beneficiaries were in programme for about 11 months on average.Unit of allocation or exposure: HHs\t \tParticipants\tBaseline characteristicsIntervention or exposure: NRControl: NROverall: NRInclusion criteria: 1. Eligible governorates: those where the share of Takaful\u00e2\u0080\u0090eligible HHs (HH eligibility defined as having a PMT score \u00e2\u0089\u00a4 4500) in the governorate was \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 0.5%. Therefore, governorates that had a very small share of eligible HHs in TKP were excluded, in part to help manage survey costs. The only exception was governorates in the Frontier region, where the share of eligible HHs was < 0.5%. These governorates were kept so that the Frontier region, which may have had different sources of poverty and food insecurity, was represented in the evaluation sample. 2.

Therefore, the HHs on either side of the cutoff were similar and provided valid comparison groups. There were NO baseline data \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the above related to (quote): \"Finally, we check whether adding some HH characteristics to the specifications affects our impact estimates. Rather than include all of the variables in the PMT score (which would be endogenous and also highly correlated with the PMT score, which is a requirement for inclusion in the generalised IV and RD models), we include a subset of potentially exogenous HH characteristics (such as HH size, education level of the HH head) as controls in the specification.\"Attrition per relevant group: as there was no baseline and follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up of participants in this study, no attrition was reported.

However, Karama ended up not being evaluated.Description: Takaful (Solidarity) is a family income support scheme, conditioned on school attendance and health outcomes. Cash transfers are conditioned on attendance of \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 85% of the school days by children aged 6\u00e2\u0080\u009318 years, and on conducting 2 visits per year to the health clinics by mothers and children aged < 6 years; in addition to maintaining child growth monitoring records, and attending nutrition awareness sessions. Takaful transfers start from a basic amount of EBP 325 per HH per month, which increases depending on the number of children in the HHs and their educational level. When the programme was first designed, each HH used to receive EBP 60 for each child in primary education, EBP 80 for each child in preparatory education and EBP 100 for each child in secondary education. HHs could receive benefits for up to 3 children. Conditionalities for school attendance and healthcare utilisation had yet to be implemented. Therefore, this was treated as a UCT.Duration of intervention period: beneficiaries had been in programme for about 11 months on average. Maximum period: about 2 years and 4 months (28 months). First payments: March 2015 (but note that many HHs were included more recently).Frequency: from start of programme to end of 2016, transfers were delivered on quarterly basis for Takaful. Starting in 2017, transfers for Takaful were monthly.Number of study contacts: 1; no baseline data. Data for impact evaluation collected at survey conducted in 1.Providers: implemented by the MoSS, and co\u00e2\u0080\u0090financed by the Government of Egypt and the World Bank.Delivery: frequency of transfers changed over time. Some people had to travel to collect the money but this was not identified as a deterrent. The survey data showed that 63% of programme applicants did not face any challenges while applying. HHs that became beneficiaries had more challenges than HHs that did become beneficiaries, which may be because the non\u00e2\u0080\u0090beneficiaries were excluded or gave up early in the application process. Applicants who did not become beneficiaries, however, were more likely (about 8% of applicants) to say that there was insufficient explanation of the process. The programme experience in terms of transfers was also positive. There were almost no reports of problems with the transfers in the survey. About 93% of programme beneficiaries in the sample faced no challenges in receiving the transfers.Co\u00e2\u0080\u0090interventions: none reported.Resource requirements: NREconomic indicators: NRControlNo intervention (registrant HHs just above the PMT Score threshold)\t \tOutcomes\tDietary diversity: HH DDS (0\u00e2\u0080\u009312); mother's DDS; child 6\u00e2\u0080\u0090 to 23\u00e2\u0080\u0090month DDS; child 24\u00e2\u0080\u0090 to 59\u00e2\u0080\u0090month DDSAnthropometry: HAZ; wastedMorbidity: % children aged < 5 years who had diarrhoea in past 4 weeks; % children aged < 5 years who had fever in past 4 weeksAdverse outcomes: overweight\t \tIdentification\tSponsorship source: UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office (UK FCO)Country: EgyptSetting: poor HHs.

There needed to be \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 29 VCs included in the study.Sampling method: in the first sampling stage, 2 traditional authorities were randomly selected from each of the 2 study districts. The second sampling stage consisted of randomly selecting 14 VCs within the 2 traditional authorities in Mangochi and 15 VCs from Salima for a total of 29 study VCs. The final sampling stage was at the HH level; in Mangochi VCs, where the number of eligible HHs tended to be high, 125 eligible HHs were randomly selected in each of the 14 study VCs.

Intervention HHs declared interest in participating and the control group comprised sample HHs taken from the general population.Sample size justification and outcome used: sample size was calculated based on approximate estimates from past studies on food sufficiency, HDDS, IDDS and WAZ. These calculations indicated that 20 primary sampling units, comprising 14 HHs, per district was sufficient; resulting in 560(?) HHs per group.Sampling method: 2\u00e2\u0080\u0090stage sampling approach employed. First, 8/18 districts purposefully selected, and each intervention group was allocated 2 districts. Sample of HHs that declared interest in participating in VSL/AM activities was drawn and a sample from general population was drawn for the control group. Then PSUs were selected: in intervention group, PSUs were VSL groups, and in the control group the PSUs were the EAs from the 2007 Census. Second, HHs were selected: eligible HHs within selected PSUs were enumerated and random sample drawn. HH participation was voluntary. PSUs were randomly selected with probability proportionate to size (in terms of number of HHs represented).Study aim or objective: to evaluate the impact of participation in an economic\u00e2\u0080\u0090strengthening initiative, namely VSL groups, on HH and child nutritional outcomes, with an additional focus on identifying possible gaps and areas for complementary programming.Study period: August 2009\u00e2\u0080\u0093August 2012Unit of allocation or exposure: provincial districts allocated to intervention groups\t \tParticipants\tBaseline characteristicsIntervention or exposureAge: mean number of children aged < 5 years: VSL: 0.84 (SE 0.87); VSL + AM: 1.04 (SE 0.87); mean age of HH head, years: VSL 43.19 (SE 14.28); VSL + AM: 38.77 (SE 11.43)Place of residence: NRSex: male\u00e2\u0080\u0090headed HHs, %: VSL: 90.54; VSL + AM: 86.90Ethnicity and language: NROccupation: agriculture primary occupation, %: VSL: 87.72: VSL + AM: 90.18Education: mean education of HH head, years: VSL: 3.28 (SE 3.00); VSL + AM: 3.90 (SE 2.92); mean education of spouse, years: VSL 1.83 (SE 2.04); VSL + AM 2.49 (SE 5.58)SES: mean HH size: VSL 4.70 (SE 2.03); VSL + AM: 5.47 (SE 1.97); annual HH income: VSL: MZM 9398 (SE 18,088); VSL + AM: 11,525 (SE 22,482)Social capital: NRNutritional status: mean months of food sufficiency: VSL: 10.41; VSL + AM: 9.27; mean HDDS: VSL: 4.06; VSL + AM: 4.20; mean IDDS: VSL: 2.51; VSL + AM: 2.99; mean WAZ: VSL: \u00e2\u0080\u00931.21; VSL + AM: \u00e2\u0080\u00930.96Morbidities: NRConcomitant or previous care: SANA (Seguranca Alimentar de Nutricao e Agricultura) \u00e2\u0080\u0093 number NRControlAge: mean number of children aged < 5 years: 0.62 (SE 0.78); mean age of HH head, years: 43.34 (SE 13.93)Place of residence: NRSex: male\u00e2\u0080\u0090headed HHs, %: 90.30Ethnicity and language: NROccupation: agriculture primary occupation, %: 87.55Education: mean education of HH head, years: 3.33 (SE 3.21) years; mean education of spouse, years: 1.44 (SE 1.84)SES: mean annual HH income: MZM 8843 (20,354)Social capital: NRNutritional status: VSL matched mean months of food sufficiency: 10.58; VSL + AM matched mean months of food sufficiency: 10.47; VSL matched mean HDDS: 3.73; VSL + AM matched mean HDDS: 3.82; VSL matched mean IDDS: 2.87; VSL + AM matched mean IDDS: 2.82; VSL matched mean WAZ: \u00e2\u0080\u00931.25; VSL + AM matched mean WAZ: \u00e2\u0080\u00931.15Morbidities: NRConcomitant or previous care: SANA (Seguranca Alimentar de Nutricao e Agricultura) \u00e2\u0080\u0093 number NROverallAge: mean number of children aged < 5 years: 0.84 (SE 0.85); mean age of HH head, years: 41.85 (SE 13.46)Place of residence: NRSex: % male\u00e2\u0080\u0090headed HHs: 89.3Ethnicity and language: NROccupation: agriculture primary occupation, %: 88.43Education: mean education of HH head, years: 3.50 (SE 3.07); mean education of spouse, years: 2.03 (SE 5.18)SES: mean HH size: 4.94 (SE 2.02); mean annual HH income: MZM 9858 (SE 20,412).Social capital: NRNutritional status: NRMorbidities: NRConcomitant or previous care: SANA \u00e2\u0080\u0093 number NRInclusion criteria: HHs expressing interest in participating in the activity their district was randomised to.Exclusion criteria: NR.Pretreatment: NR.

Will policy targets with different levels of specificity, e.g. general ones such as malnutrition prevention and specific ones such as anaemia reduction, lead to different behavioural responses and, thus, nutritional and health outcomes, partly through different incentives attached to these policy targets (since certain incentives are presumably needed to achieve any specific policy target)?Study period: October 2009\u00e2\u0080\u0093May 2010Unit of allocation or exposure: cluster: elementary schools\t \tParticipants\tBaseline characteristicsNutrition subsidyAge: NRPlace of residence: NRSex: entire group (analysed group): mean proportion of boys: 0.52 (0.49)Ethnicity and language: entire group (analysed group): mean proportion of ethnic\u00e2\u0080\u0090minority students: 0.62 (0.64); mean proportion with migrant father: 0.71 (0.80); mean proportion with migrant mother: 0.11 (0.12)Occupation: NREducation: entire group (analysed group): mean proportion of fifth graders: 0.49 (0.56); mean education of father, years: 6.12 (6.11); mean education of mother, years: 4.32 (4.32); mean proportion of senior\u00e2\u0080\u0090level teaching staff: 0.48 (0.48)SES: entire group (analysed group): mean number of siblings: 2.18 (2.19)Social capital: NRNutritional status: entire group: mean BMI\u00e2\u0080\u0090for\u00e2\u0080\u0090age z\u00e2\u0080\u0090score: \u00e2\u0080\u00930.78; mean Hb concentration (g/L): 128.06; mean proportion of underweight students: 0.07; mean proportion of anaemic students: 0.22; DDS (adapted from FAO guidelines): 5.12.

Table A1: most variables were quite balanced across groups, with minor differences due to sampling errors, suggesting that the random group assignments were done reasonably well. However, due to the modest number (i.e. 59) of project schools, some student or school characteristics may have been balanced across the 3 groups (Appendix A Table A1), even under randomised group assignments. To address this issue, the authors modified the estimating equation. Quote: \"Unless otherwise stated, all estimates presented below are obtained after controlling for the full set of covariates reported in Appendix A Table A1.\"Attrition per relevant group: 61% of boarding students (who were considered in the analysis) were not analysed because they did not have health information collected due to budgetary reasons. Considering the full sample of 6994, attrition was 88%.Description of subgroups measured and reported: NRTotal number completed and analysed per relevant group: to fully capture the impacts of the treatments, the authors' analysis focused only on the 2199 boarding students in the sample (of 6994 students). Due to budgetary reasons, while dietary information was collected from all (boarding) students, health information was collected only from about half of them: 1020 boarding students had information on Hb concentration level, 952 had height and weight information, and 866 had both sets of information. Thus, the final analytical sample comprised 866 boarding students with information available on all 3 dimensions. Students: 219/582 (38%) for nutrition subsidy; 210/563 (36%) for nutrition subsidy + monetary incentive; 437/1550 (28%) for control group.Total number enrolled per relevant group: total sample 6994.

The monetary equivalent of the total amount of nutrition subsidy provided to each school in this group was CNY 225 (USD 33) per enrolled student (which cost CNY 1.5/day, enough for purchasing 60 g of red meat, for 150 days). The subsidy money was transferred to the bank account of each school and the schoolmasters were able to use this money for nutrition\u00e2\u0080\u0090related expenses (in any way they deemed reasonable). In addition, each schoolmaster in this treatment group was informed about the main aim of the intervention project (i.e. to reduce child malnutrition) and was given 3 pieces of additional information: 1. the proportion of enrolled students who were anaemic (not the specific individuals but the mean rate of the whole school), 2. descriptions of effective methods for reducing iron\u00e2\u0080\u0090deficient anaemia and 3. details about anaemia's relation with school attendance, educational performance and cognitive development. However, the project team did not provide any specific instructions or stipulate specific requirements on what foods the schools should purchase; schoolmasters were allowed to make their own decisions on how the subsidy money was spent to achieve the goal of malnutrition reduction.Duration of intervention period: 6 months: November 2009\u00e2\u0080\u0093May 2010, with a 1\u00e2\u0080\u0090month pause during the winter break in February 2010.Frequency: 1Number of study contacts: 2 contacts: baseline (October 2009) and follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up (May 2010).Providers: project team and local government.Delivery: CNY 225 (equivalent to USD 33) per student, enough to purchase 60 g of red meat per day for 150 days, was transferred into the school's bank account.Co\u00e2\u0080\u0090interventions: NRResource requirements: CNY 225 per student. Human resource requirements were minimal, as the money was transferred to the school bank account and administered by the schoolmasters.Economic indicators: NRNutrition subsidy + monetary incentive (treatment group 2)Food access intervention category: food pricesIntervention type: food subsidy with additional incentiveDescription: nutrition subsidy identical to treatment group 1, + a specific policy target of 'anaemia reduction'. Involved an incentive in the form of a potential monetary bonus provided to schoolmasters; amount was tied to actual reductions in anaemia prevalence among students in their schools \u00e2\u0080\u0093 more specifically, a schoolmaster would receive a CNY 150 (or USD 22) bonus for each of his other students whose status changed from being anaemic to being non\u00e2\u0080\u0090anaemic over the course of the intervention. As with schoolmasters in treatment group 1, those in treatment group 2 were informed about the main aim of the intervention project (i.e. to reduce child malnutrition) and were provided with the same 3 pieces of anaemia\u00e2\u0080\u0090related information. Similarly, they were allowed to make their own decisions on how the subsidy money was spent; no requirements were imposed by the project team or the local government.Duration of intervention period: November 2009\u00e2\u0080\u0093May 2010, with a pause of 1 month (February 2010) during the winter break.Frequency: 1Number of study contacts: 2 contacts: baseline (October 2009) and follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up (May 2010).Providers: project team and local government.Delivery: CNY 225 (equivalent to USD 33) per student, enough to purchase 60 g of red meat per day for 150 days, was transferred into the school's bank account. Since the bonus provided to schoolmasters in treatment group 2 would not be realised until the end of the intervention period when the actual reductions in anaemia prevalence were revealed (note that it may not even be realised if there are no reductions in anaemia prevalence), the actual amount of subsidy per student received by the 2 treatment groups (i.e. the amount that could be used for food purchase per student terms) was identical during the intervention.Co\u00e2\u0080\u0090interventions: NRResource requirements: CNY 225 per student, + CNY 150 for each anaemic student converted to non\u00e2\u0080\u0090anaemic.

This is predominantly due to only including boarding students with Hb and anthropometric data, as well as the loss of 1 control cluster. Attrition appears to be differential for the control group versus the intervention groups.\t \tSelective outcome reporting (Reporting bias)\tUnclear risk\tNo study protocol available.\t \tOther bias\tUnclear risk\tRecruitment bias: randomisation of schools occurred after students had been recruited; low risk.

TABLE: Daidone 2014 TABLE: Study characteristics\t \tMethods\tStudy design: cRCTStudy grouping: parallel groupHow were missing data handled? investigated attrition at 24\u00e2\u0080\u0090month follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up by testing for similarities at baseline between 1. treatment and control groups for all non\u00e2\u0080\u0090missing HHs (differential attrition) and 2. all HHs at baseline and the remaining HHs at the 24\u00e2\u0080\u0090month follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up (overall attrition). Testing these groups on baseline characteristics can assess whether the benefits of randomisation are preserved at follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up. There was no significant differential attrition at 24\u00e2\u0080\u0090month follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up, meaning that benefits of randomisation were preserved. There were small differences between study population at baseline and those that remained at 24\u00e2\u0080\u0090month follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up; the remaining HHs were less likely to have experienced a shock, especially flooding or drought at baseline, and they consumed a higher proportion of maize over cassava. The differences from overall attrition were primarily driven by the lower response rate in Kaputa district.Randomisation ratio: about 1:1Recruitment method: 90/300 CWACs in the 3 districts were randomly selected and ranked through a lottery to be considered in the programme. In second phase, CWAC members and Ministry staff identified all eligible HHs with \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 1 child under the age of 3 years living in these 90 randomly selected communities. This resulted in > 100 eligible HHs in each of the CWACs.Sample size justification and outcome used: power analysis completed to ensure study size was able to detect meaningful effects.Sampling method: randomised phase\u00e2\u0080\u0090in method that included several levels of random selection. First, 90/300 CWACs in the 3 districts were randomly selected and ranked through a lottery to be considered in the programme. In second phase, CWAC members and Ministry staff identified all eligible HHs with \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 1 child under the age of 3 years living in these 90 randomly selected communities. This resulted in > 100 eligible HHs in each of the CWACs. After implementing a power analysis to ensure the study was able to detect meaningful effects, 28 HHs were randomly selected for inclusion in the evaluation from each of the 90 communities. This yielded a final study sample of > 2500 HHs. Baseline data collection carried out before CWACs were randomly assigned to treatment and control. Importantly, neither the HHs nor the enumerators knew who would benefit first and who would benefit later. Randomisation was concluded with the flip of a coin and was carried out in public with local officials, Ministry staff and community members.Study aim or objective: CGP has 6 specific objectives: 1. supplement and not replace HH income; 2. increase the number of children enrolled in and attending school; 3. reduce the rate of mortality and morbidity among children aged < 5 years; 4. reduce stunting and wasting among children aged < 5 years; 5. increase the number of HHs owning assets such as livestock and 6. increase the number of HHs that have a second meal a day.Study period: 3\u00e2\u0080\u0090year RCT; began in December 2010 and ended in 2013.

TABLE: Doocy 2017 TABLE: Study characteristics\t \tMethods\tStudy design: PCSStudy grouping: N/AHow were missing data handled? With exception of imputation procedures for child anthropometric data, analysis did not consider interim measures of each indicator because after exploratory analysis, it became clear that inclusion of interim data points did not change results and conclusions, and thus eliminating analysis of interim measures would facilitate the interpretation of findings. Used a multiple imputation approach for anthropometric outcomes, where missing values were replaced by values sampled from a distribution defined by the fit of a linear regression model at a given follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up as a function of previous outcomes, as well as of child age and sex. Missing values for maternal age was assigned the mean and education the mode of those variables, so they could be included in the analysis.Randomisation ratio: N/ARecruitment method: at enrolment, a full description of study was read to prospective participants and they had the opportunity to ask questions about participation; those who agreed to participate gave oral consent due to high levels of illiteracy. At each subsequent survey, the respondent was read an abbreviated consent statement and asked to re\u00e2\u0080\u0090affirm their willingness to participate prior to the interview (Doocy 2018). Study enrolment occurred between August and October 2012 following identification of beneficiaries for each intervention. 1820 beneficiaries and their HHs were enrolled and followed over 3.5 years during February/March 2016; study HHs were followed for the entire period, regardless of whether they graduated or dropped out of intervention.Sample size justification and outcome used: primary outcome measure was reduction in HH food insecurity, and authors conducted calculations for varying levels of reduction, assuming 80% power and a significance level of 0.05. With a minimum sample size of 325 HHs per group (or 1625 HHs in total for the parent study), study was powered to detect a 10% or greater reduction in prevalence of food insecurity indicators within each comparison group compared to baseline levels.Sampling method: The Jenga Jamaa II parent study used a quasi\u00e2\u0080\u0090experimental matched design in which communities planned to receive 1 intervention (vs multiple interventions) selected for participation so that the effect of individual interventions could be assessed. Authors analysed 2 of the 5 comparison groups recruited for the parent study of Jenga Jamaa II: the FFS intervention group (388 participants) and the control group (324 participants). Participating communities within each territory (Fizi and Uvira) were matched by livelihood zone (mountains, plains or lakeside) and proximity into sets of villages with each type of intervention. The final sample had 13 sets of 3 villages; within each set of villages, 1 village received agricultural interventions, 1 received PM2A, and 1 received WEGs. In each set of villages, intervention groups were formed (i.e. 1 intervention per village) and all beneficiaries in the group were enrolled in the study. In agricultural intervention villages, the entire FFS group of approximately 30 beneficiaries was enrolled in the study. Controls were selected from WEG villages, where each beneficiary was matched with a female neighbour not participating in Jenga Jamaa II interventions, and that woman's HH was enrolled as a control. Villages were assigned to an intervention based on agreement with local leaders and availability programme resources; intervention participants were identified based on programme targeting criteria and community selection processes. Once intervention groups were formed, all group members were invited to participate in the research. In agriculture villages, 1 FFS with approximately 30 participants was enrolled; 1 of 3 farmer\u00e2\u0080\u0090to\u00e2\u0080\u0090farmer trainees of each FFS participant was randomly selected to comprise the F2F group. In WEG villages, 1 WEG group of 25 participants was selected. Members of the control group were also selected from WEG villages because the WEG intervention had lower coverage than FFS/farmer\u00e2\u0080\u0090to\u00e2\u0080\u0090farmer and PM2A interventions (i.e. there was only 1 WEG group per village compared to multiple PM2A and agricultural intervention groups), which lessened the likelihood of spillover effects on control HHs.Study aim or objective: to examine the changes in agricultural production practices, HH food security and child nutritional status that are associated with participation in FFS programmes. Study derived from a subset of data from the parent study of Jenga Jamaa II which sought to address HH food insecurity and child undernutrition through 1. increasing incomes among farming HHs through FFS and farmer\u00e2\u0080\u0090to\u00e2\u0080\u0090farmer training interventions, 2. improving the health and nutritional status of children aged < 5 years through the PM2A, and 3. empowering women via WEGs.Study period: HHs were followed for 3.5 years, from enrolment in autumn of 2012 (baseline) to February or March 2016 (endline).Unit of allocation or exposure: villages\t \tParticipants\tBaseline characteristicsFFSsAge: n, mean, years: 37.9 (SD 13.4); children aged < 2 years, n, mean: 0.5 (SD 0.5); children aged 2\u00e2\u0080\u00934 years, n, mean: 1.5 (SD 1.1)Place of residence, %: proportion in Fizi territory: 46.2; proportion in Uvira territory: 53.8Sex: female, %: 69.4Ethnicity and language: NROccupation: NREducation: mean years of education: 3.4 (SD 3.6)SES: number of income sources, mean: 2.0 (SD 1.0); proportion with land ownership, %: 69.5; HH size, mean: 6.2 (SD 2.4)Social capital: NRNutritional status: HDDS, mean: 3.4 (SD 1.4); proportion moderately and severely food insecure (HFIAS), %: 97.8Morbidities: NRConcomitant or previous care: NRControlAge: children aged < 2 years, n, mean: 0.7 (SD 0.5); children aged 2\u00e2\u0080\u00934 years, n, mean: 1.8 (SD 1.1)Place of residence: proportion in Fizi territory, %: 46.2; proportion in Uvira territory, %: 53.8Sex: NREthnicity and language: NROccupation: NREducation: NRSES: mean number of income sources: 1.8 (SD 0.9); proportion with land ownership, %: 68.6; HH size, mean: 6.3 (SD 2.4)Social capital: NRNutritional status: mean HDDS: 3.4 (SD 1.5); proportion moderately and severely food insecure (HFIAS), %: 98.4Morbidities: NRConcomitant or previous care: NRWEGsAge: mean, years: 34.0 (SD 8.8)Place of residence: proportion in Fizi territory, %: 46.2; proportion in Uvira territory, %: 53.8Sex: female, %: 100Ethnicity and language: NROccupation: NREducation: mean years of education: 2.8 (SD 3.1)SES: mean number of income sources: 1.9 (SD 0.9); proportion with land ownership, %: 70.2; HH size, mean: 6.6 (SD 2.3)Social capital: NRNutritional status: mean HDDS: 3.4 (SD 1.7); proportion moderately and severely food insecure (HFIAS), %: 99Morbidities: NRConcomitant or previous care: NROverall (all intervention groups; including those irrelevant to the review)Age: mean, years: 33.4 (SD 11.4)Place of residence: proportion in Fizi territory, %: 46.2; proportion in Uvira territory, %: 53.8Sex: female, %: 86.1Ethnicity and language: NROccupation: NREducation: mean years of education: 3.1 (SD 3.5)SES: mean number of income sources: 1.9 (SD 0.9); proportion with land ownership, %: 69.7Social capital: NRNutritional status: mean HDSS: 3.4 (SD 1.5); proportion moderately and severely food insecure (HFIAS), %: 98.5Morbidities: NRConcomitant or previous care: NRInclusion criteria: intervention participants identified based on programme targeting criteria and community selection processes.

Each FFS group received semimonthly training from ADRA field agents for 2 years. Each FFS group had a community demonstration plot, and group members also received starter packages of seeds and tools for use on individual farms. The FFS programmes focused on a variety of common crops in the region, including cassava, maize, rice, beans, banana and peanuts. The first year of training focused on knowledge of production systems and technologies; second year focused on adoption of techniques and technologies, and behaviour change. Content was designed to be crop\u00e2\u0080\u0090specific and seasonally appropriate. After completing the FFS intervention, many beneficiaries transitioned to farmer business associations, which were intended to improve access to credit and marketing opportunities.Duration of intervention period: 3.5 yearsFrequency: every 2 weeksNumber of study contacts: 8 (August/September 2012; February/March 2013; August/September 2013; February/March 2014; August/September 2014; February/March 2015; August/September 2015; February/March 2016)Providers: implemented by ADRA.Delivery: training sessions on agriculture techniques and other content by field agents, with a community demonstration plot; provision of starter packages of seeds and tools; some reports of delayed seed arrival and inefficient tools that delayed processes. Insecurity complicated both programme delivery and data collection in some communities. Possible that spillover from the intervention areas affected the control areas.Co\u00e2\u0080\u0090interventions: some FFS participants trained 3 farmers from their community in FFS techniques (F2F programme). This was supposed to be a scalable and less resource intensive intervention to increase agricultural input. After FFS intervention, some transitioned to farmer business associations, which were intended to improve access to credit and marketing opportunities.Resource requirements: small incentive \u00e2\u0080\u0093 which was most often soap and worth approximately USD 1 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 for participation in each survey.Economic indicators: NRControlFood access intervention category: no interventionIntervention type: no interventionDescription: no interventionDuration of intervention period: no interventionFrequency: no interventionNumber of study contacts: study HHs followed for 3.5 years, from enrolment autumn 2012 (baseline) to February or March 2016 (endline), graduated or dropped out of intervention.

TABLE: Evans 2014 TABLE: Study characteristics\t \tMethods\tStudy design: cRCTStudy grouping: parallel groupHow were missing data handled? Authors carried out both ETT and ITT regressions. However, in ETT analyses, treated HHs were those assigned to the intervention and actually received the intervention, whereas in an ITT analysis 'treated' HHs were those that were assigned to intervention, regardless of whether they actually received it. It appears as data not collected was excluded from the analysis.Randomisation ratio: 1:1; 40 intervention and 40 control communitiesRecruitment method: HHs were invited to enrol in the pilot. Enrolment of beneficiaries carried out in each community, with the enrolment process lasting 1\u00e2\u0080\u00933 days, depending on total number of beneficiary HHs in the community. The enrolment team identified who would receive payments in each HH (usually the mother of the children in the HH if present), updated family information, linked children and the elderly with schools and health centres, provided an orientation session about the programme, and provided identity cards.Sample size justification and outcome used: once all communities were assigned into groups, power calculations identified the need to interview a mean of 25 HHs per community. With a total of 80 participating communities (40 treatment and 40 control) and a standardised effect size of 0.20, it was expected to need to interview 20 HHs per community to achieve 80% power. 25 HHs per community were then interviewed since not every HH would have vulnerable children: some few HHs would only have vulnerable elderly people. Calculation assumed 95% CIs for statistical significance and an intracluster correlation of 0.05.Sampling method: pilot study implemented in districts and communities targeted under TASAF I, which targeted the poorest and most vulnerable districts of Tanzania using a rigorous selection process. Regions were ranked using several indicators (poverty level, food insecurity, primary school gross enrolment ratio, access to safe water, access to health facilities, AIDS case rates and road accessibility). Districts were then prioritised within the regions using an index of relative poverty and deprivation constructed using data from Tanzania's 1992 Income and Expenditure Survey. Targeting done using screening forms designed to identify vulnerable children and elderly people based on specific criteria, which were defined by the communities themselves. The CMCs used these poverty indicators to identify the poorest (approximately) half of HHs in the community. Validation of the list of eligible HHs was done by the village assembly, allowing for community validation. They ranked HHs by priority. Random selection of control and treatment communities was done after identification of vulnerable HHs in all 80 communities.Study aim or objective: pilot project aiming to develop operational modalities for the community\u00e2\u0080\u0090driven delivery of a CCT programme through a social fund operation; and test the effectiveness of the community\u00e2\u0080\u0090based CCT model and ensure that lessons from the pilot informed government policy on support for vulnerable families.Study period: 31\u00e2\u0080\u009334 months: January 2010 (when first payments were made) to October 2012 (endline survey).Unit of allocation or exposure: communities (with random selection of HHs within communities allocated to each intervention group)\t \tParticipants\tBaseline characteristicsIntervention or exposureAge: adults aged 18\u00e2\u0080\u009359 years, n: 1.08; children, n: 1.69; elderly people, n: 1.91Place of residence: villages in TanzaniaSex: NREthnicity and language: NROccupation: HHs in agricultural self\u00e2\u0080\u0090employment, %: about 72Education: child ever in school (% children): 78.36; child (aged 6\u00e2\u0080\u009317 years) now in school: 86.98; repeated a grade (% children in school); taken a national examination (% children in school): 98.09; own exercise books (% children in school): 94.48SES, % HH: bank account: 1.6; borrowed part year: 19.3; improved roof: 33.0; improved floor: 3.0; improved toilet: 69.1; piped water: 30.2; electricity: 0.0Social capital: contributed labour to a community development project, % HHs: 36.25.

In districts where the local government was certified compliant via Tanzania's Local Government Development Capital Grant programme, TASAF disbursed 5 payments to a bank account managed by the LGA, which disbursed the funds directly to the community\u00e2\u0080\u0090managed accounts. If the local government was not qualified to receive capital development grants, TASAF disbursed the funds directly to the community\u00e2\u0080\u0090managed accounts. The CMCs were then responsible for making payments to beneficiary HHs. Monitoring of conditions began after the first payment was disbursed to beneficiaries in January 2010, and then was done every 4 months. The monitoring process was conducted by TASAF and the CMCs, with support from schools, health centres and district staff. If beneficiaries failed to comply with the conditions, a warning was issued to them by the CMCs. If, after the next monitoring period (8 months after the first payment), beneficiaries still failed to comply with conditions, payments were reduced by 25% and a second warning was sent. After 2 warnings, beneficiaries who failed to comply were suspended indefinitely, but allowed to return to the programme after review and approval by the communities and TASAF. CMCs were responsible for monitoring and also visited beneficiary HHs regularly to keep abreast of any developments. HHs could also leave or be asked to leave the programme for the following reasons: if they chose to opt out, and had informed the CMC, if the HH no longer had an elderly person or a child age < 15 years who was in primary school, if HH members failed to comply with conditions after a warning had been issued 3 consecutive times for children and 2 consecutive times for elderly people.Co\u00e2\u0080\u0090interventions: transfers from government/TASAF or from NGOs/religious organisationResource requirements: 'staff' involved in delivering intervention: CMCs village council, village assembly.

WHZ data coded as missing if WHZ > +5 or WHZ < \u00e2\u0080\u00935; HAZ data coded as missing if HAZ > +5 or HAZ < \u00e2\u0080\u00936. A child's data were excluded from the analysis if the child was deemed to be a different child to the child enrolled at baseline. While checks were in place to ensure that the same child was measured every month, in some cases these were not followed. Used criteria for exclusion a decrease in height or length > 1 cm (measurement error) or an increase > 15 cm (considered the maximum height a child could grow in 6 months). All effect analyses were ITT.Randomisation ratio: 1:1:1:1Recruitment method: Action Against Hunger provided the initial HH lists, and these were further verified and updated by the study research team. HHs defined as poor and very poor were selected. Field officers then visited identified HHs to share details of study and get informed consent before collecting baseline data. Study participants were enrolled by data collection team and were unaware which intervention they would be getting at enrolment. However, blinding of participants was not possible due to nature of intervention. Data collection team was different to cash and voucher disbursement team. Data collection team was responsible for collection of data and sensitisation of the study recipients to use of cash and vouchers. Data collection team was accompanied by local research mobilisers who facilitated the data collectors (e.g. in locating HHs), and were responsible for delivering key BCC messages.Sample size justification and outcome used: target sample size (about 632 HHs per group) was calculated to measure a detectable difference of prevalence of being wasted of 7% between the intervention and the control groups postintervention. Sample size was powered to detect a 0.19 WHZ difference between the intervention and the control groups. Sample size was reached for the standard cash transfer, food voucher and control groups. However, for the double cash transfer group, the sample size was 600 due to the different funding amounts given for this group, which did not allow for an equivalent number of HHs to be included compared to the other 3 groups. Target sample size was calculated using an estimated ICC of 0.02 for prevalence of being wasted from an Action Against Hunger nutrition survey in Dadu District. ICC for prevalence of being wasted was 0.01 (Fenn 2017).Sampling method: it was not possible to carry out a public randomisation, therefore, randomisation was done by the principal investigator using a random number table to generate the randomisation sequence and then drawing village names from a box. Block randomisation was done, allowing equal distribution of the villages to each group for small (< 40 HHs), medium (40 (SD 85) HHs) and large (> 85 HHs) villages. The investigator had no knowledge of the villages involved and was not involved in the intervention implementation or any data collection. HHs were selected from villages from 3 agricultural areas sharing similar livelihoods, geography and access to the same elements of the standard WINS programme. Action Against Hunger provided the initial HH lists, and these were further verified and updated by the study research team. HHs defined as poor or very poor using eligibility criteria decided by research team with village participation, and based on ownership of cultivated land and number of goats and with \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 1 children aged 6\u00c2\u00b148 months were selected. The study was a closed cohort and followed all children in the same eligible HHs regardless of their baseline anthropometric status.Study aim or objective: to evaluate 3 cash\u00e2\u0080\u0090based transfer modalities on nutritional outcomes in children aged < 5 years from poor and very poor HHs in Dadu District, Sindh Province, Pakistan. Aimed to 1. compare the nutrition status of children receiving either a seasonal UCTs or a fresh food voucher with those with access to Action Against Hunger care only, after 6 months and 1 year; 2. assess the costs and cost\u00e2\u0080\u0090effectiveness of the different interventions; 3. understand the factors that determined the ways in which HHs used the different transfers and 4. explore the role of the different processes involved in the study outcomes and how they interact with the context (Fenn 2015).Study period: data for the main impact analysis and findings reported here involved 3 periods: baseline (May\u00e2\u0080\u0093July 2015), 6 months after baseline (December 2015), and 1 year after baseline (June/July 2016).Unit of allocation or exposure: villages\t \tParticipants\tBaseline characteristicsStandard cash transferAge: child, months, mean: 25.6 (SD 12.3)Place of residence: NRSex: girls, n/N (%): 433/905 (47.9)Ethnicity and language: ethnicity, n (%): Sindhi 587 (94.2), Balochi 36 (5.8), Punjabi 0 (0).

HHs defined as poor or very poor using eligibility criteria decided upon by the research team with village participation, and based on ownership of cultivated land and number of goats and with \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 1 children aged 6 (SD 48) months were selected.Exclusion criteria: NRPretreatment: baseline characteristics of clusters and participants between the different intervention and control groups were well balanced for mothers and their children, apart from the proportion of children who had received deworming treatment, which was lower in the control group. There were a few potential imbalances at the HH level and between villages due to the clustered nature of the study design. These included village size, ethnicity, access to safe water and distance to nearest health service. In the control group, there was a higher proportion of HHs of Balochi ethnicity. There also appeared to be differences in the SES and educational status of mothers and fathers (both lower) and a higher number of HHs participating in the BISP in control group (Fenn 2017).Attrition per relevant group: no evaluation clusters LTFU; response rates for HHs were 95.6% and children were 98.3% within clusters at 6 months and for HHs were 95.0% and children were 96.8% at 1 year. 109 (1.6%) children missing (WHZ outliers, excluded children, missing data at either time point): control 31, double cash 32, food voucher 24 standard cash 22.

Action Against Hunger ensured that all food voucher villages had good access to these shops, by nominating shops in, or nearby, these villages. All villages were served by \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 1 nominated shop. Vouchers were disbursed at same time every month for 6 consecutive months.Duration of intervention period: 6 months (July 2015 to December 2015)Frequency: monthlyNumber of study contacts: baseline; 6 months; 12 monthsProviders: funded by the EU.Delivery: food vouchers disbursed to participating HHs at the village level. Disbursement of cash and vouchers was done by different organisations. The food voucher group had more direct contact with Action Against Hunger field staff during voucher disbursement, which could have affected the results through greater exposure to key messages. It is also possible that the vouchers themselves were too restricted. They were designed to purchase fresh fruit, vegetables, and fresh meat and were, therefore, dependent on what the vendors stocked, such as chicken being the only available meat. There were also many anecdotal reports regarding vendors overcharging for food items redeemed against the vouchers as a way to cover their own administration fees in recovering the voucher costs. In this respect, the actual transfer value given may have been lower than the face value.Co\u00e2\u0080\u0090interventions: all villages had access to the WINS programme, which provided outpatient treatment for children aged 6 (SD 59) months with severe acute malnutrition, micronutrient supplementation (children and pregnant and lactating women) and BCC.

Parishes stratified into rural and urban groups and from each group, treatment and comparison parishes were randomly selected.Study aim or objective: to analyse the impact of a programme that transfers cash to women in rural Ecuador on measures of ECD (Paxson 2010). First objective was to use a randomised effectiveness trial in Ecuador to address the question of whether very young children (aged 12\u00e2\u0080\u009335 months) benefit in terms of health outcomes or language development if their families receive a cash transfer (Fernald 2011; study included a subset of younger children only).Study period: duration of intervention during which participants received transfers was unclear. Rural families in treatment group were eligible for the transfer for 17 months prior to the follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up survey. Rural families became eligible for transfer from June 2004, and urban families in November 2006 and follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up survey was conducted between September 2005 and January 2006.Unit of allocation or exposure: parishes allocated to intervention and control groups but certain HHs only selected for inclusion in study.\t \tParticipants\tBaseline characteristicsIntervention or exposureAge: mother, years, mean: 26.51 (SE 7.22); child, months, mean: 38.82 (SE 13.13)Place of residence: urban: 46% (365)Sex: child male, mean: 0.494 (SE 0.5)Ethnicity and language: NROccupation: NREducation: mother's education, years, mean: 6.88 (SE 2.94).SES: number of family members, mean: 4.78 (SE 2.19)Social capital: mother living with husband, mean: 0.696 (SE 0.460)Nutritional status: mother's elevation\u00e2\u0080\u0090adjusted Hb, mean: 11.64 (SE 1.44).

Eligible families received USD 15 per month. They were not required to withdraw their USD 15 on a monthly basis but could allow transfers to accumulate for up to 4 months.Duration of intervention period: HHs were eligible for 17 months before follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up, but it was unclear whether they were receiving transfers during the entire period.Frequency: monthlyNumber of study contacts: 2: baseline (October 2003\u00e2\u0080\u0093March 2004) and follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up (September 2005\u00e2\u0080\u0093January 2006)Providers: transfers administered by the Government of Ecuador and distributed through a large network of private banks (Banred) and the National Agricultural Bank (Banco Nacional de Fomento) (Schady Araujo, 2006) (Fernald 2011). Baseline and follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up surveys were conducted by the World Bank and the Government of Ecuador (Fernald 2011)Delivery: transfers were given to mothers rather than fathers and were distributed through the banking system, although beneficiaries did not need to have a bank account to receive them. The fraction of rural families that received transfers among families randomised into the BDH treatment group climbed quickly once the programme became available, reaching 56% by January 2005 and 60% by January 2006. Overall, 75% of sampled families in the treatment parishes received a transfer in \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 1 month since June 2004. Mean monthly transfer across all treatment\u00e2\u0080\u0090group families, between January 2005 and November 2006, was USD 10.51. This was less than amount planned. According to survey response data, there was very little contamination of intervention: take\u00e2\u0080\u0090up of the BDH programme was 73% for the treatment group and 3% for the comparison group.Co\u00e2\u0080\u0090interventions: NRResource requirements: NREconomic indicators: NRControl: no intervention\t \tOutcomes\tAnthropometry: HAZ; heightBiochemical: HbCognitive function and development: language (TVIP score and IDHC\u00e2\u0080\u0090B score); long\u00e2\u0080\u0090term memory; short\u00e2\u0080\u0090term memory; visual integrationAnxiety and depression: mother's depression score (CES\u00e2\u0080\u0090D); mother's PSS\t \tIdentification\tSponsorship source: Center for Economic and Policy Studies at Princeton University, the government of Ecuador, and the World BankCountry: EcuadorSetting: rural and urban parishesAuthor's name: Lia FernaldEmail: fernald@berkeley.eduDeclarations of interest: NRStudy or programme name and acronym: Bono de Desarrollo Humano (BDH) programmeType of record: journal article\t \tNotes\t\u00c2\u00a0\t \tRisk of bias\t \tBias\tAuthors' judgement\tSupport for judgement\t \tRandom sequence generation (Selection bias)\tUnclear risk\tStudy was randomised but authors did not report how random sequence was generated.\t \tAllocation concealment (Selection bias)\tLow risk\tAllocation was at parish level at beginning of study, and all eligible HHs that were in these parishes were either in intervention or control group.

TABLE: Ferre 2014 TABLE: Study characteristics\t \tMethods\tStudy design: PCSStudy grouping: N/AHow were missing data handled? exclusions: the high attrition rate in Narayanganj, while not unusual given the high frequency of in and out migration among the residents of urban slums, was clearly a challenge for any social programme targeted towards the urban slum population. Due to this high attrition rate in Narayanganj, the impact evaluation was restricted to the Jaldhaka sample.Randomisation ratio: N/ARecruitment method: project: following a public information campaign on the project objectives and duration, the targeting and enrolment processes were carried out. Shombhob set up an open registration process where interested HHs with \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 1 child aged 0\u00e2\u0080\u009336 months or at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 1 primary school\u00e2\u0080\u0090aged child (or both) were invited to apply for selection. Out of the 37,801 families who applied, the poorest 15,952 families were selected based on their PMT scores. The list of eligible beneficiaries was validated by community leaders, and verified by UP chairmen, and the Mayor's office in case of Narayanganj City Corporation.Sample size justification and outcome used: NR, but eligible families were requested to enrol, and this process was completed in April 2012. The final number of enrolled HHs was 14,125.Sampling method: random: 1. random sample of 3000 HHs drawn from the census list (all HHs in the 5 project unions of Jaldhaka) and interviewed. 2. HHs were randomly selected within each of the 4 demographic groups and within each of 2 PMT score groups (below 25th percentile and between 25th and 50th percentiles). (Note: HHs were assigned to the treatment group by a non\u00e2\u0080\u0090random assignment rule based on the assignment variable. The eligibility for becoming beneficiaries of a programme was solely determined by whether they were below or above the unique cut\u00e2\u0080\u0090off point.)Study aim or objective: 1. to test the delivery of CCTs to the poorest HHs through local governments to reduce their HH poverty levels; 2. increase school attendance of beneficiary children going to primary school, and 3. improve the nutritional status of beneficiary children aged 0\u00e2\u0080\u009336 months.Study period: baseline (survey conducted): May/June 2011.

Of the 37,801 families who applied for the programme, the poorest 15,952 were selected based on their PMT scores. This meant the cut\u00e2\u0080\u0090off thresholds for selection was a PMT score of 660 for the 2 rural Upazilas. Eligible families had scores below the treatment cut\u00e2\u0080\u0090off (treatment group) and ineligible families with had scores above the cut\u00e2\u0080\u0090off (control group).Exclusion criteria: PMT score above the cut\u00e2\u0080\u0090off.Pretreatment: most of the differences between the treatment and control HHs were nutrition outcomes. Treatment HHs appeared to be worse off compared to the control HHs in the incidence of stunting, wasting, underweight, knowledge of breastfeeding and dietary diversity. The same is true in terms of HH consumption. However, school attendance (defined as the number of classes missed in the last 2 weeks) and enrolment rates were almost identical. The DiD estimator assumes that the mean change in the control group represents the counterfactual change in the treatment group if there was no treatment. This allows a reliable inference of programme impact by comparing the pre\u00e2\u0080\u0090 to postintervention change in the outcome of interest for the treated group relative to a control group.Attrition per relevant group: Jaldhaka (rural): 114Description of subgroups measured and reported: NRTotal number completed and analysed per relevant group: Jaldhaka (rural) analysed only.

Condition: regular school attendance (\u00e2\u0089\u00a5 80% every month) for enrolled children in primary school.Duration of intervention period: due to start up delays, implementation began in February 2012, allowing transfers to be provided for 21 months (from April 2012 to December 2013). In addition, the project faced additional implementation challenges due to the annual floods that hit the project locations during August and September. School closures due to these floods constituted the most serious implementation challenge given focus of the transfers on regular school attendance. These implementation challenges coupled with the fact that the impact evaluation only covered 13 months of cash transfers were likely to affect the impact of the intervention on some indicators.Frequency: bi\u00e2\u0080\u0090monthly cash transfersNumber of study contacts: 2Providers: local governmentsDelivery: innovative electronic payments system developed with the BPO, which provided cash cards to beneficiary mothers to make transfers electronically to their accounts with the Post Office.

The BPO arranged for a mobile team to travel with the machines and cash to the village centres on a designated day during each payment cycle.

Missing data were excluded from the analyses.Randomisation ratio: 1:1:1 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 bank account and UCT (100 HHs); bank account and no UCT (100 HHs); no bank account or UCT (100 HHs)Recruitment method: study authors collaborated with the Self\u00e2\u0080\u0090Employment Women's Association to explain the experiment to a 12\u00e2\u0080\u0090block community of Raghubir Nagar. Awareness campaign ran for 2 weeks (first week of August 2010 to 13 August 2010). It initially targeted groups of 15\u00e2\u0080\u009320 people, but, because ration shop owners tried to influence people to avoid participation in experiment, group sizes were reduced to 5 or 6 people at a time, to make their participation less noticeable.Sample size justification and outcome used: NRSampling method: random selection of 350 HHs that had agreed to participate, of which 50 dropped out. These 300 HHs were selected for treatment group and control groups 1 and 2. Random selection of 150 HHs that did not want to participate were selected for control group 3.Study aim or objective: to compare effects of replacing welfare transfers in\u00e2\u0080\u0090kind with a UCT on food security (measured as food consumption) to determine the impact of the cash transfer and the bank account.Study period: January 2011 to December 2011Unit of allocation or exposure: HHs\t \tParticipants\tBaseline characteristicsIntervention: bank account + UCTAge: NRPlace of residence: poor community in DelhiSex: NREthnicity and language: NROccupation, %: HHs self\u00e2\u0080\u0090employed: 44; regular salary employed: 34; casual labour: 15; other: 7Education: education level of HH head, %: primary: 78; secondary: 19; above secondary: 3SES: poor HHs BPLSocial capital: NRNutritional status: data reported were unclear; per capita Kcal consumption, mean: 47,480 (SD 23,004)Morbidities: NRConcomitant or previous care: previous care: PDS BPL card \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in\u00e2\u0080\u0090kind food transferControl 1: bank account and no cash transferAge: NRPlace of residence: poor community in DelhiSex: NREthnicity and language: NROccupation, %: HHs self\u00e2\u0080\u0090employed: 36; regular salary employed: 39; casual labour: 22; other: 3Education: education level of HH head, %: primary: 62; secondary: 36; above secondary: 2SES: poor HHs BPLSocial capital: NRNutritional status: per capita Kcal consumption, mean: 43,954 (SD 13,446).Morbidities: NRConcomitant or previous care: previous care: PDS BPL card \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in\u00e2\u0080\u0090kind food transferControl 2: no bank account + cash transferAge: NRPlace of residence: poor community in DelhiSex: NREthnicity and language: NROccupation, %: HHs self\u00e2\u0080\u0090employed: 43; regular salary employed: 30; casual labour: 23; other: 4Education: education level of HH head, %: primary: 68; secondary: 30; above secondary: 2SES: poor HHs BPLSocial capital: NRNutritional status: per capita Kcal consumption, mean: 47,398 (SD 21,908)Morbidities: NRConcomitant or previous care: previous care: PDS BPL card \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in\u00e2\u0080\u0090kind food transfersControl 3: random selection of 150 HHs that did not want to participate.

Per capita expenditure on non\u00e2\u0080\u0090food items was significantly different between the control groups 1 and 2; which was linked to differences in personal care expenditures between men and women.Attrition per relevant group: attrition in treatment group: 6 (6%); control group 1: 3 (3%); control group 2: 9 (9%); control group 3: 14 (9.3%)Description of subgroups measured and reported: N/ATotal number completed and analysed per relevant group: total number completed and analysed in treatment group 94; control group 1: 97; control group 2: 91; control group 3: 136Total number enrolled per relevant group: total number enrolled to participate 300 HHs. 100 HHs per group (intervention group, control group 1 and control group 2)Total number randomised per relevant group: 100 HHs per group (intervention group, control group 1 and control group 2)\t \tInterventions\tIntervention characteristicsIntervention: bank account and UCTFood access intervention category: increase buying powerIntervention type: UCTDescription: bank accounts opened in name of women in the HH and UCTs started. Government stamps on ration cards indicated that they could not use their rations for 1 year; instead, they received a monthly cash transfer of INR 1000 (about USD 18), with no conditions on how to spend it, Deposited every month, from January 2011 and ending in December 2011.Duration of intervention period: 12 months: January\u00e2\u0080\u0093December 2011Frequency: monthlyNumber of study contacts: 3: baseline, midline (July 2011) and endline (December 2011)Providers: researchersDelivery: bank accounts created for cash transfers. UCT included an exit option for all recipients after 6 months, which was important because the UCT replaced a public programme to which HHs already had access. Therefore, given option to go back to the PDS (4% did, but 96% wanted to continue UCTs and not in\u00e2\u0080\u0090kind transfers). According to author analyses, it appeared that money transferred was used to buy food, as they showed that after initiating UCTs there were no changes to non\u00e2\u0080\u0090food items or alcohol.Co\u00e2\u0080\u0090interventions: noneResource requirements: NREconomic indicators: monthly cash transfer of INR 1000Control 1: bank account and no cash transferFood access intervention category: increase buying powerIntervention type: bank account openedDescription: bank accounts opened in the name of the women in HHs but no cash transfers done.Duration of intervention period: 12 months: January 2011 to December 2011Frequency: onceNumber of study contacts: 3: baseline, midline (July 2011) and endline (December 2011)Providers: researchersDelivery: other than creation of bank accounts nothing else reportedCo\u00e2\u0080\u0090interventions: NRResource requirements: NREconomic indicators: NRControl 2: no bank account or cash transferControl 3: 150 HHs that did not want to participate, therefore no bank account or cash transfer.

List of beneficiary HHs presented to a community assembly for review and discussion and list was changed according to established criteria for the selection of beneficiary families (process called densification). No other criteria reported.Exclusion criteria: NRPretreatment: overall, communities were comparable but this was not the case at HH or individual level. HHs in the intervention group were bigger, had more children but fewer adults aged > 55 years compared to control group (Hoddinott 2003). No difference in illness rates or number of visits to clinics for nutrition monitoring between control and treatment groups (Gertler 2000).Attrition per relevant group: overall attrition varied between papers and there was no report of attrition per group. 3350/12,291 (27%) intervention HHs did not receive the intervention by March 2000. Of these, 2872 HHs were not incorporated into programme; 478 HHs chose not to participate (no official records) or moved out of locality (Skoufias 2005). Attrition per group NR. In total, 221 HHs excluded as reported no food was consumed within the home, and 7165 HHs excluded with caloric availability per person per day < 875 kcal or > 4.768 kcal (Hoddinott 2003).Description of subgroups measured and reported: NRTotal number completed and analysed per relevant group: total 16,614 HHs, which excluded 7386 HHs that were excluded because of inadequate data. Number analysed per group NR and also varied depending on report.Total number enrolled per relevant group: 320 communities allocated to intervention and 186 to control groups, out of 506 communities. 24,000 HHs overall in sample at beginning of study (Hoddinott 2003). 97% of HHs enrolled in programme (Gertler 2000). Baseline sample included 112,319 individuals from 18,795 HHs in 506 experimental communities. Approximately, 60% of sample came from treatment areas and 40% from control (Gertler 2000).Total number randomised per relevant group: intervention group: 320 communities; control group: 186 communities\t \tInterventions\tIntervention characteristicsIntervention or exposureFood access intervention category: increase buying powerIntervention type: CCTDescription: cash transfers to families every 2 months (food and education transfers) if: 1. every family member accepted preventive health services; 2. children aged 0\u00e2\u0080\u00935 years and lactating mothers attended nutrition monitoring clinics where their growth was measured (every 2 months for children under 24 months), immunisation, obtained nutrition supplements and they received education on nutrition and hygiene; and 3. pregnant women visited clinics to obtain antenatal care (5 visits), nutritional supplements and health education. Linked to children's school enrolment and regular school attendance and clinic attendance. Included in\u00e2\u0080\u0090kind health benefits; nutritional supplements for children aged \u00e2\u0089\u00a4 5 years, and pregnant and lactating women; and instructional meetings on health and nutritional issues. Transfers were targeted to mothers of the families (female head of HH). 3 types of monetary transfers: 1. scholarships tied to children's school attendance; 2. money for school supplies and 3. transfers for food. Amount of food transfer was 20% of HH monthly consumption expenditure preintervention. Scholarship transfers occur monthly (?), and varied depending on age and sex of the child, with maximum scholarship cap of MXN 490 pesos per HH (January\u00e2\u0080\u0093June 98) and MXN 625 per HH (July\u00e2\u0080\u0093December 1999). Food transfer also occur monthly(?) and depended on age and sex of children in HH and compliance with PROGRESA requirements.Duration of intervention period: about 2 years: April/May 1998 (benefits started) to November 1999/March 2000 (control HHs start receiving benefits)Frequency: cash transfers every 2 monthsNumber of study contacts: 4: baseline data (survey March 1998) was unusable; October 1998; June 1999; November 1999Providers: Mexico Government. Health care component administered by Ministry of Health and IMSS\u00e2\u0080\u0090Solidaridad, a branch of the Mexican Social Security Institute, which provides benefits to uninsured individuals in rural areas.Delivery: every second month. Verification of school attendance relied on completion of forms, which had to be completed and returned to PROGRESA before the initiation of payment. This often led to lags in payments. Every 2 months, confirmation of whether children of beneficiary families attend school > 85% of time was submitted to PROGRESA by school teachers and directors, and this triggered receipt of bi\u00e2\u0080\u0090monthly cash transfer for school attendance. Receipt of monetary transfers and nutritional supplements were tied to mandatory healthcare visits to public clinics. Healthcare professionals submitted certification of beneficiary visits to PROGRESA every 2 months, which triggered receipt of cash transfer for food support. About 65% of HHs received the PROGRESA cash transfers, due to administrative errors and delays in the final registration of beneficiary HHs (for more details see Skoufias 2005). Another unique feature was that the cash transfers were given to mother of HH, a strategy designed to target the funds within the HH to improve the children's education and nutrition. Fernald 2009: compliance verified by clinics and schools, and about 1% of HHs were denied cash transfers for non\u00e2\u0080\u0090compliance.Co\u00e2\u0080\u0090interventions: none reported. 1 additional requirement of the PROGRESA programme was that HHs benefiting from PROGRESA were to stop receiving benefits from other pre\u00e2\u0080\u0090existing programmes such as Ninos de Solidaridad, Abasto Social de Leche, de Tortilla and the National Institute of Indigenous people.Resource requirements: community health and education facilitiesEconomic indicators: programme's budget was USD 777 million for 1999 (0.2% of GDP). Cost of intervention: mean monthly payments of MXN 197 per beneficiary HH (November 1998); mean of MXN 99 for food and MXN 91 for school attendance. The programme operated in almost 50,000 rural villages in 31 states. PROGRESA's budget was about USD 800 million or 0.2% of GDP (Gertler 2000).Control: no intervention (started receiving benefits 2 years later)Co\u00e2\u0080\u0090interventions: none reported.

TABLE: Haushofer 2013 TABLE: Study characteristics\t \tMethods\tStudy design: RCTStudy grouping: parallelHow were missing data handled? missing data due to attrition excluded from analysis. Analyses were based on total 1372 HHs, which is the sum of HHs at baseline only.Randomisation ratio: 1:1 (503:505)Recruitment method: after HHs and members identified, in private conversation, members were asked questions about demographics, and informed that they had been chosen to receive a cash transfer of KES 25,200 (USD 404). The recipient was informed that this transfer was unconditional, that they were free to spend it however they chose, and that it was a one\u00e2\u0080\u0090time transfer and would not be repeated.Sample size justification and outcome used: sample size 500 individuals in each of the treatment, control and pure control group was chosen based on a power calculation, which showed that a sample of 1000 individuals was sufficient to detect effect sizes of 0.2 SD for all treatment vs pure control HHs with 89% power. Different treatment groups within the treatment groups (male vs female recipient, lump\u00e2\u0080\u0090sum vs monthly, large vs small transfers) could be compared with 60% power (from registry record).Sampling method: purposive sampling of villages and HHs followed by random selection of HHs into treatment or control groups. GiveDirectly selected poor HHs by identifying poor regions of Kenya according to census data. Region chosen was Rarieda, a peninsula in Lake Victoria west of Kisumu in Western Kenya. GiveDirectly identified target villages through a rough estimation of the population of villages and the proportion of HHs lacking a metal roof, which is GiveDirectly's targeting criterion. Identified 126 villages. 63 of these villages were randomly chosen to be treatment villages. Control villages were only surveyed at endline; in these villages, authors sampled 432 HHs referred to as 'pure control' HHs. In treatment villages, second stage of randomisation assigned 50% of HHs to treatment condition, and 50% to control condition. Process resulted in 503 treatment HHs and 505 control HHs in treatment villages at baseline. Note: numbers were different between reports.Study aim or objective: to assess the relative welfare impacts of 3 design features of UCTs: gender of transfer recipient; temporal structure of transfers (monthly vs lump\u00e2\u0080\u0090sum); and magnitude of transfer.Study period: transfers between June 2011 and January 2013Unit of allocation or exposure: HHs\t \tParticipants\tBaseline characteristicsIntervention or exposureAge: treatment effect vs control, coefficient: \u00e2\u0080\u00931.15 (SE 0.86).

Lump\u00e2\u0080\u0090sum transfers: a month was randomly chosen among the 9 months following the date of the initial visit. For receipt of transfer, recipients were provided with a SIM card by Kenya's largest mobile service provider, Safaricom, and asked to activate it and register for Safaricom's mobile money service M\u00e2\u0080\u0090Pesa. HHs with both a primary female and primary male member stratified on recipient gender and randomly assigned the woman or the man to be the transfer recipient in an equal number of HHs. 258/503 treatment HHs were assigned to monthly group, and 245 to the lump\u00e2\u0080\u0090sum group. Total amount of each type of transfer was KES 25,200 (USD 404). Amount included an initial transfer of KES 1200 (USD 19) to incentivise M\u00e2\u0080\u0090Pesa registration, followed by either a lump\u00e2\u0080\u0090sum payment of KES 24,000 (USD 384) lump\u00e2\u0080\u0090sum group, or 9 monthly transfers of KES 2800 (USD 45) each in the monthly group. 137 HHs in the treatment group were randomly chosen and informed in January 2012 that they would receive an additional transfer of KES 70,000 (USD 1112), paid in 7 monthly instalments of KES 10,000 (USD 160), beginning in February 2012. Thus, the transfers previously assigned to these HHs, whether monthly or lump\u00e2\u0080\u0090sum, were augmented by KES 10,000 from February 2012 to August 2012, and, therefore, the total transfer amount received by these HHs was KES 95,200 (USD 1525). The remaining 366 treatment HHs constituted the 'small' transfer group, and received transfers totalling KES 25,200 (USD 404) per HH.Duration of intervention period: 20 months. Transfers were made between June 2011 and January 2013.Frequency: lump sum or monthly transfers. 258/503 treatment HHs assigned monthly group, and 245 to lump\u00e2\u0080\u0090sum group. Total amount of each type of transfer was KES 25,200 (USD 404), which included an initial transfer of KES 1200 (USD 19) to incentivise M\u00e2\u0080\u0090Pesa registration, followed by either a lump\u00e2\u0080\u0090sum payment of KES 24,000 (USD 384) in the lump\u00e2\u0080\u0090sum group, or 9 monthly transfers of KES 2800 (USD 45) each in the monthly condition. In both the monthly and the lump\u00e2\u0080\u0090sum groups, recipients received the initial transfer of KES 1200 immediately following the announcement visit by GiveDirectly. In the monthly group, recipients received the first transfer of KES 2800 on the first of the month following M\u00e2\u0080\u0090Pesa registration, and the remaining 8 transfers of KES 2800 on the first of the 8 following months. In the lump\u00e2\u0080\u0090sum group, recipients received the lump\u00e2\u0080\u0090sum transfer of KES 24,000 on the first of a month chosen randomly among the 9 months following enrolment.Number of study contacts: 2 (baseline and endline)Providers: GiveDirectly NGODelivery: for lump\u00e2\u0080\u0090sum group, a small initial transfer of KES 1200 was sent on the first of the month following the initial GiveDirectly visit as an incentive for prompt registration. Registration had to occur in the name of the designated transfer recipient, rather than any other person. To facilitate easier communication with recipients and reliable transfer delivery, GiveDirectly offered to sell mobile phones to recipient HHs that did not own 1 (by reducing the future transfer by the cost of the phone). In a few additional cases, delays in registration occurred due to delays in obtaining an official identification card, which was a prerequisite for registering with M\u00e2\u0080\u0090Pesa. Withdrawals and deposits could be made at any M\u00e2\u0080\u0090Pesa agent (about 11,000 throughout Kenya). GiveDirectly reported that recipients typically withdrew the entire balance of the transfer upon receipt. Due primarily to registration issues with M\u00e2\u0080\u0090Pesa, 18 treatment HHs had not received transfers at endline, thus, only 485 of the treatment HHs had received transfers.Co\u00e2\u0080\u0090interventions: NRResource requirements: GiveDirectly estimated the mean travel time from recipient HHs to the nearest M\u00e2\u0080\u0090Pesa agent was 42 minutes.Economic indicators: GiveDirectly estimated the mean cost from recipient HHs to the nearest M\u00e2\u0080\u0090Pesa agent at USD 0.64. Withdrawals incur costs between 27% for USD 2 withdrawals and 0.06% for USD 800 withdrawals, with a gradual decrease of the percentage for intermediate amounts. The sender also incurred costs for M\u00e2\u0080\u0090Pesa transfers; according to GiveDirectly's estimates, the costs of transferring money to recipients in this was amount to 1.5% of the transfer amount for foreign exchange fees, and 1.6% for M\u00e2\u0080\u0090Pesa fees. Together with 4.8% of transfers spent on recipient identification and staff costs, GiveDirectly estimated that 92.1% of the donations it received were transferred to recipients' M\u00e2\u0080\u0090Pesa accounts.Control: no intervention\t \tOutcomes\tProportion of HH expenditure on food: Total monthly HH food expenditure (cereals, tubers, meat/fish, dairy, fruit/vegetables, other food, food eaten out,Food security: FSI (based on weighted mean of measures of food security and hunger based on 17 outcome measures)Anthropometry: MUAC; height; weightAnxiety and depression: psychological well\u00e2\u0080\u0090being index (standardised weighted mean of 6 psychological and neurobiological measures); log cortisol; CES\u00e2\u0080\u0090D; Cohen PSS\t \tIdentification\tSponsorship source: NIH Grant R01AG039297 and Cogito Foundation Grant R\u00e2\u0080\u0090116/10 to Johannes Haushofer.Country: KenyaSetting: poor rural villages in KenyaComments: additional documentation: online Appendix.

TABLE: Hidrobo 2014 TABLE: Study characteristics\t \tMethods\tStudy design: cRCTStudy grouping: parallelHow were missing data handled? Overall attrition 10%. Authors excluded data from HHs LTFU and with missing data but they constructed worse\u00e2\u0080\u0090case scenarios to assess effects of excluding missing data. Construct worst\u00e2\u0080\u0090case scenarios by assuming those HHs who select into the sample because of treatment (marginal HHs) were at the very top or very bottom of the outcome distribution. No differences in estimates observed in these analyses.Randomisation ratio: neighbourhoods and clusters randomised into 4 treatment groups using percentages of 20/20 for the control and food groups, and 30/30 for the cash and food voucher groups. 80 neighbourhoods and 145 clusters were randomised.Recruitment method: each HH in the selected neighbourhood was visited, mapped and administered a 1\u00e2\u0080\u0090page questionnaire with basic demographic and socioeconomic questions.Sample size justification and outcome used: NRSampling method: Neighbourhoods within urban centres were chosen for the intervention by WFP in consultation with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) as areas that had large numbers of Colombian refugees and relatively high levels of poverty. Each HH was visited, mapped and administered a 1\u00e2\u0080\u0090page questionnaire that consisted of basic demographic and socioeconomic questions designed to develop a PMT to define programme eligibility. However, based on point scores by nationality, the decision was made to automatically enrol all Colombian and mixed\u00e2\u0080\u0090nationality HHs. First, neighbourhoods were randomised to either treatment or control group; second, all treatment clusters (geographical units within neighbourhoods) were randomised to cash, food voucher or food transfer. 1 unexpected complication in study design was change in beneficiary criteria implemented during baseline survey data collection. In process of surveying HHs, it was concluded that the targeting for transfers was too broad, resulting in the inclusion of HHs who were relatively well off. This led to a retargeting process where HHs who were relatively well off were dropped from the programme. Since there were not enough HHs in existing neighbourhoods to replace those that had been excluded and still reach programme enrolment targets, the decision was made to expand coverage to additional neighbourhoods on the outer circle of urban areas. These areas were subsequently rerandomised into treatment groups according to the approximate percentage lost.Study aim or objective: to compare the impact and cost\u00e2\u0080\u0090effectiveness of cash, food vouchers and food transfers on the quantity and quality of food consumed. Objectives were 3\u00e2\u0080\u0090fold: 1. to improve food consumption by facilitating access to more nutritious foods, 2. to increase the role of women in HH decision\u00e2\u0080\u0090making related to food consumption and 3. to reduce tensions between Colombian refugees and host Ecuadorian populations.Study period: May 2011 to October 2011Unit of allocation or exposure: neighbourhoods and clusters (geographical units within neighbourhoods)\t \tParticipants\tBaseline characteristicsControlAge: mean, years: 41.71.

Although USD 40 was less than most HH's total monthly food consumption at baseline, the quantity of food received for each item was higher than what the median HH in the sample consumed at baseline, which suggests that for many HHs the items from the food transfer would be extra\u00e2\u0080\u0090marginal. Nutrition sensitisation was a key component of the programme, aimed at influencing behaviour change and increasing knowledge of recipient HHs, especially in regard to dietary diversity. To ensure a consistent approach to knowledge transfer, a curriculum was developed by WFP to be covered during each monthly training session. Topics included: 1. programme sensitisation and information, 2. family nutrition, 3. food and nutrition for pregnant and lactating women, 4. nutrition for children aged 0\u00e2\u0080\u009312 months and 5. nutrition for children aged 12\u00e2\u0080\u009324 months. All participants regardless of transfer modality participated in training, and transfers were conditional on attendance. In addition to monthly meetings, posters and flyers on nutrition were developed and posted at distribution sites, including supermarkets, banks, food warehouses and community centres to further expose participants across all 3 modalities to messaging. Flyers covered topics such as recommended food groups, daily nutritional requirements, proper sanitation and food preparation processes.Duration of intervention period: May 2011 to October 2011Frequency: monthly food transfer per HHNumber of study contacts: 2: March\u00e2\u0080\u0093April 2011 (baseline) and October\u00e2\u0080\u0093November 2011 (follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up)Providers: WFP (NPO)Delivery: food transfer was valued according to regional market prices at USD 40 and included rice (24 kg), vegetable oil (4 L), lentils (8 kg) and canned sardines (8 cans of 0.425 kg). Although USD 40 was less than most HH's total monthly food consumption at baseline, the quantity of food received for each item was higher than what the median HH in the sample consumed at baseline, which suggested that for many HHs the items from the food transfer would be extramarginal. Transfers were conditional on attending nutrition sensitisation training. Across all modalities, beneficiaries reported extremely high rates of satisfaction with both the programme and programme transparency, believed that the programme was fair, and reported that programme employees treated them with respect. On average, 99% of beneficiaries reported receiving their transfers in totality and 97% reported that they received all information needed to understand how the programme worked. Across the 3 modalities, a minimum of 88% of beneficiaries stated that they received their scheduled payments on time and that they knew how many transfers they would receive. Knowledge gained from the nutrition sensitisation sessions, as measured by a set of questions at baseline and follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up, was also similar across modalities. < 1% of voucher and food beneficiaries reported selling their food or voucher. Food HHs reported that the remainder was saved for later use (29.4%) and shared with others outside the HH (6.8%).Co\u00e2\u0080\u0090interventions: NRResource requirements: food transfer was significantly more expensive due to the cost of transport to distribution sites and rental of storage facilities. Repackaging bulk items for distribution was also costly, accounting for approximately 30% of the cost of food distribution. Moreover, costs of food did not tend to decrease with economies of scale because much of the modality\u00e2\u0080\u0090specific costs were physical resource costs such as transport and re\u00e2\u0080\u0090packaging. In terms of opportunity costs from time spent travelling to the distribution point and waiting to receive their transfers, food beneficiaries spent on average 93 minute.Economic indicators: costs in per\u00e2\u0080\u0090transfer terms: cost to provide a food transfer was USD 11.46 (Appendix Table B.8). It was considerably less expensive to provide cash (USD 42.99 per transfer) or vouchers (USD 43.27 per transfer) than food (USD 58.22 per transfer). Food recipients spend slightly more, USD 2.12, as many had to use taxis to carry home the heavy loads of food given at the distribution points.Cash transferFood access intervention category: increase buying powerIntervention type: CCTDescription: USD 40 transferred monthly onto preprogrammed debit cards. Cash transfer HHs were able to retrieve the cash any time; however, it had to be taken out in bundles of USD 10. Nutrition sensitisation was a key component of the programme, aimed at influencing behaviour change and increasing knowledge of recipient HHs, especially in regard to dietary diversity. To ensure a consistent approach to knowledge transfer, a curriculum was developed by WFP to be covered during each monthly training session.

In terms of opportunity costs from time spent travelling to the distribution point and waiting to receive their transfers, cash recipients spent 45 minutes travelling and waiting.Economic indicators: costs in per\u00e2\u0080\u0090transfer terms: the cost to provide cash transfer, USD 2.99 (Appendix Table B.8). It is considerably less expensive to provide cash (USD 42.99 per transfer) or vouchers (USD 43.27 per transfer) than food (USD 58.22 per transfer). Cash and recipients spend an average of USD 1.46 per month on transportation and other out\u00e2\u0080\u0090of\u00e2\u0080\u0090pocket expenses to retrieve transfers.Food voucherFood access intervention category: food pricesIntervention type: conditional food voucherDescription: food vouchers valued at USD 40 and given in denominations of USD 20, redeemable for a list of nutritionally approved foods at central supermarkets in each urban centre. List consisted of cereals, tubers, fruits, vegetables, legumes, meats, fish, milk products and eggs. Food vouchers could be used over a series of 2 visits per month and had to be redeemed within 30 days of receipt. Vouchers were serialised and printed centrally, and were non\u00e2\u0080\u0090transferable.

Knowledge gained from the nutrition sensitisation sessions, as measured by a set of questions at baseline and follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up, was also similar across modalities.Co\u00e2\u0080\u0090interventions: NRResource requirements: significant staff costs were associated with supermarket selection and negotiation of contracts, and voucher reconciliation and payment. These staff costs accounted for nearly 90% of the cost of implementing the voucher component of the intervention. In terms of opportunity costs from time spent travelling to the distribution point and waiting to receive their transfers, voucher beneficiaries spent on average 92 minutes.Economic indicators: costs in per\u00e2\u0080\u0090transfer terms: cost to provide a voucher, USD 3.27 (Appendix Table B.8). It was considerably less expensive to provide cash (USD 42.99 per transfer) or vouchers (USD 43.27 per transfer) than food (USD 58.22 per transfer) Voucher recipients spent an average of USD 1.65 per month on transportation and other out\u00e2\u0080\u0090of\u00e2\u0080\u0090pocket expenses to retrieve vouchers.Control: no intervention\t \tOutcomes\tFood expenditure per capita per month (log values)Dietary diversity: DDI; HDDS; FCS; proportion with poor food consumption; number of days a HH consumed foods from each individual food groupDiet intake: log per capita caloric intake per person per day \u00e2\u0080\u0093 total and per food group/item\t \tIdentification\tSponsorship source: Government of Spain received through the WFP and funding provided by the CGIAR's Policy, Institutions and Markets research programme to IFPRI.Country: EcuadorSetting: poor neighbourhoods within 7 urban centres in the provinces of Carchi and Sucumb\u00c3\u00adosAuthor's name: Melissa HidroboEmail: m.hidrobo@cgiar.orgDeclarations of interest: NRStudy or programme name and acronym: N/AType of record: journal article\t \tNotes\t\u00c2\u00a0\t \tRisk of bias\t \tBias\tAuthors' judgement\tSupport for judgement\t \tRandom sequence generation (Selection bias)\tUnclear risk\tAuthors stated that neighbourhoods and clusters were randomised to either intervention groups but there was no description of how the random sequence was generated.\t \tAllocation concealment (Selection bias)\tHigh risk\tThe unit of allocation was neighbourhoods.

Of these, 52 villages were included in final sample since it would have been too complicated/led to tension if proximate villages shared a work site (5670 HHs). Phase 2: 50% of HHs in each village were targeted to receive the same transfer without having to fulfil a work requirement (2786 HHs).

It was first estimated as a simple random sample, which was further multiplied by a design effect of 1.4 to take into account the complex sample design.Sampling method: nutritional impact substudy was conducted in a random selection of 205/320 communities scheduled to enrol in the programme at the end of 1998 and 142 communities randomly selected from the 186 communities that enrolled 1 year later, in late 1999. The communities for the larger PROGRESA evaluation were randomly selected; more details in Gertler 2000).Study aim or objective: to document the short\u00e2\u0080\u0090term nutritional impact of a large\u00e2\u0080\u0090scale, incentive\u00e2\u0080\u0090based development programme in Mexico (Progresa) (Rivera 2004).

Transfer associated with school attendance varied according to number of children attending school and their grade. PROGRESA provided micronutrient fortified foods for women and children and health services and cash transfers for family. Food supplements were targeted to the groups of individuals that were more likely to benefit from the product. Families received the universal cash transfer as long as they complied with specific healthcare appointments in health centres for all family members, including immunisations, well baby care and growth monitoring of children, antenatal and postnatal care and education for women, check\u00e2\u0080\u0090up visits for other family members, and a mandatory session on nutrition and health education. Monthly transfers averaged about USD 25 per family. Typically, cash transfers added about 20\u00e2\u0080\u009330% to HH income.Duration of intervention period: about 2 years: May 1998 to November 1999/March 2000 (?)Frequency: every 2 monthsNumber of study contacts: 3: August\u00e2\u0080\u0093September 1998 (baseline); September\u00e2\u0080\u0093December 1999 and November\u00e2\u0080\u0093December 2000Providers: federal government of MexicoDelivery: lump sum payment once completed forms were submitted by HHs to verify school attendance. Actual transfers to each HH depended on age and sex of children in HH and their compliance with the programme.

HHs in the treatment groups were given printed vouchers entitling them to a price reduction of CNY 0.10, CNY 0.20 or CNY 0.30 off the price of each 500 g of staple good. Subsidy stayed fixed for each HH over course of study. These subsidies represented substantial price changes, since the mean preintervention price of rice in Hunan was CNY 1.2 per 500 g, and the mean for wheat flour in Gansu was CNY 1.04 per 500 g.Duration of intervention period: June\u00e2\u0080\u0093October 2006Frequency: vouchers printed in quantities of 1, 5 and 10 jin (500 g), and 1\u00e2\u0080\u0090month supply of vouchers was distributed at start of each month, with each HH receiving vouchers for 750 g per person per day (about twice the mean per capita consumption as measured by the preintervention survey). All vouchers remained valid until the end of the intervention, giving HHs time to spend down any accumulated vouchers at end of study.Number of study contacts: baseline (April 2006) with 2 follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090ups (September and December 2006)Providers: survey and intervention conducted by employees of provincial\u00e2\u0080\u0090level agencies of Chinese National Bureau of Statistics.Delivery: printed food vouchers entitling intervention HHs to the subsidy corresponding with its intervention level. Vouchers were redeemable at local grain shops, the owners of which were later reimbursed for the cost of the vouchers and given a fixed payment for complying with the guidelines in implementing the subsidy. HHs could use the vouchers only to purchase the province\u00e2\u0080\u0090specific staple good and were not permitted to resell the vouchers or the goods purchased with the vouchers (they were told there would be auditing and accounting to make sure they were in compliance with the rules, and that any violations would result in their removal from the study without any additional compensation).Co\u00e2\u0080\u0090interventions: NRResource requirements: NREconomic indicators: NRControl: no intervention\t \tOutcomes\tAdequacy of dietary intake: caloric/protein intake per capitaMineral Sufficiency index, Vitamin Sufficiency Index\t \tIdentification\tSponsorship source: National Institute of Aging, the William F.

First, provinces in which the programme had not been introduced as of October 2008 were enumerated. Of the 11 provinces available, 3 were excluded because of security concerns. From the remaining 8 provinces, 4 provinces were chosen to span all 3 macro areas of the country (North, Visayas and Mindanao). Next, in each of these 4 provinces, 2 municipalities were randomly chosen to represent the mean poverty level of areas covered by the programme. Within each selected municipality, 130 villages were randomly assigned to treatment and control groups of 65 villages each. Data for the HH assessment form to run the PMT for beneficiary selection were fielded in the 8 RCT municipalities between October 2008 and January 2009. This was followed by the implementation of Pantawid in treated villages, with the first payment of cash grants commencing in April 2009. Data used in this analysis were collected in a follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up survey from the 130 villages in October and November 2011, allowing for a programme exposure period of 30\u00e2\u0080\u009331 months.Sample size justification and outcome used: because this evaluation was a cRCT with treatment assignment at the village level, a power analysis (Supplemental Table 1) was conducted using the 3 main outcomes of interest: monthly per capita HH consumption, school participation by children aged 6\u00e2\u0080\u009314 years, and health facility visits by children aged 0\u00e2\u0080\u00935 years. In keeping with the programme's stated objective of improving child health and nutrition, the central research question of the impact evaluation was to estimate the programme effect on child health and education. However, at the time of the power calculations, data on child anthropometric measurements were N/A for the Philippinesat, a decentralised level; as a result, these outcomes were omitted from the power calculations despite their being a central concern of the impact evaluation. The 2007 Family Income and Expenditure Survey and the 2003 National Demographic Health Survey data sets were used as proxies for outcome mean and variance in the comparison population. A modest hypothesised impact ensured an adequately powered study. The power analysis used a 10% increase in HH per capita expenditures, a 7 pp increase in school enrolments in children aged 6\u00e2\u0080\u009314 years, and a 7 pp increase in health facility visit rate in children aged 0\u00e2\u0080\u00935 years. Intracluster correlation coefficients were 0.12\u00e2\u0080\u00930.25, depending on the outcome of interest. These factors combined to suggest an RCT size of 3900 HHs randomly selected from 134 enumeration clusters.Sampling method: eligible poor HHs were identified by the survey conducted by the National Household Targeting System for Poverty Reduction (NHTS\u00e2\u0080\u0090PR) that used a PMT, which estimated per capita HH income on the basis of observable and easily provided information, including HH size and physical dwelling conditions. HHs with estimated per capita income below the poverty line were classified as poor. From this subset of poor HHs, Pantawid identified eligible HHs as being those with children aged 0\u00e2\u0080\u009314 years or a pregnant woman at the time of the assessment, or both. Poor and eligible HHs received a combination of health grants and education grants every 2 months of PHP 500\u00e2\u0080\u00931400 (USD 11\u00e2\u0080\u009332), depending on number of eligible children in HH.Study aim or objective: to assess the impact of the Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program (or Pantawid Pamilya) on HAZ and stunting of young children aged 6\u00e2\u0080\u009336 months at the time of follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up survey.Study period: baseline data collected October 2008 to January 2009; follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up data collected October\u00e2\u0080\u0093November 2011Unit of allocation or exposure: villages were allocated as clusters\t \tParticipants\tBaseline characteristicsIntervention or exposureAge: children aged \u00e2\u0089\u00a4 5 years: 1.1 per HH; children aged 6\u00e2\u0080\u009314 years: 1.7 per HHPlace of residence: owned a house and lot: 31.5%Sex: NREthnicity and language: NROccupation: farming and livestock: 73.1%Education: no grade completed: 9.5% completed elementary school: 21.8%; high school graduate: 11.9%SES: house had no toilet: 41.4%; house had electricity: 42.4%; HH composition: 5.7 membersSocial capital: NRNutritional status: NRMorbidities: NRConcomitant or previous care: NRControlAge: children aged \u00e2\u0089\u00a4 5 years: 1.1 per HH; children aged 6\u00e2\u0080\u009314 years: 1.6 per HHPlace of residence: owned a house and lot: 32.9%Sex: NREthnicity and language: NROccupation: farming and livestock: 69.4%Education: no grade completed: 8.5%; completed elementary school: 21.8%; high school graduate: 10.4%SES: house had no toilet: 43.3%; house has electricity: 39.6%; HH composition: 5.7 membersSocial capital: NRNutritional status: NRMorbidities: NRConcomitant or previous care: NROverallAge: children aged \u00e2\u0089\u00a4 5 years: 1.1; children aged 6\u00e2\u0080\u009314 years: 1.7Place of residence: NRSex: NREthnicity and language: NROccupation: farming livestock: 71.3%Education: no grade completed: 9%; completed elementary school: 21.8%; high school graduate: 11.1%SES: had electricity in house: 41%Social capital: NRNutritional status: NRMorbidities: NRConcomitant or previous care: NRInclusion criteria: category 1 HH: 1418 poor HHs, i.e. HHs whose estimated per capita income fell below the poverty line, and that also had children aged 0\u00e2\u0080\u009314 years or a pregnant mother (or both) at time of assessment.Exclusion criteria: 3 provinces were excluded because of security concernsPretreatment: baseline data showed that HH characteristics were not significantly different between the 1418 category 1 treatment and control HHs.Attrition per relevant group: survey data included complete HAZ data on 194/241 treated children aged 36 months and 178/244 control children aged 36 months.

Anthropometric z\u00e2\u0080\u0090scores were calculated on the basis of the WHO growth standard. Scores > 6 SDs above or below the reference mean were dropped from the sample. This trimming resulted in the dropping 10/194 treated children and 11/178 control children from the HAZ regressions, and the dropping of 2/204 treated children and 1/189 control children from the weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090for\u00e2\u0080\u0090age regressions. 15% of those eligible in the treatment villages reported that they did not participate; NR for control villages.Description of subgroups measured and reported: N/ATotal number completed and analysed per relevant group: intervention group (children aged 6\u00e2\u0080\u009336 months): 194 had height\u00e2\u0080\u0090for\u00e2\u0080\u0090age data, and 204 had weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090for\u00e2\u0080\u0090age data; control group (children aged 6\u00e2\u0080\u009336 months): 178 had height\u00e2\u0080\u0090for\u00e2\u0080\u0090age data and 188 had weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090for\u00e2\u0080\u0090age dataTotal number enrolled per relevant group: intervention group: 241 children aged 6\u00e2\u0080\u009336 months were part of HHs that underwent survey; control group: 244 children aged 6\u00e2\u0080\u009336 months were part of HHs that underwent survey.Total number randomised per relevant group: sample of 1418 HHs was randomly assigned to 714 treated HHs and 704 control HHs for the impact evaluation.

MAFFA encourages farmers to adopt a suit of innovations rather than just a single innovation and to encourage farmer\u00e2\u0080\u0090led learning. In addition to crop diversification, many farmers increased or began to apply compost and manure to their rain\u00e2\u0080\u0090fed fields. Some farmers also experimented with botanical pesticides. MAFFA goes beyond agroecological training to focus on knowledge sharing, leadership support, nutrition and attention to social inequalities through an iterative process that integrates reflection and action, including the development of different educational activities, campaigns and training.

A conservative ITT approach was taken for determining impact estimates. 6 HHs, which had identification matching problems at follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up, were dropped entirely from analysis.Randomisation ratio: 1:1. Data for the evaluation came from a HH survey of 2000 HHs with indirect relatives of Social Welfare Fund beneficiaries in the 3 targeted districts in Al Hodeidah, half of which were in communities where indirect relatives were included in the programme (treated) and half of which were in communities where they were not included (control). (Kurdi 2019 policy brief)Recruitment method: programme targeted the poorest and the most vulnerable HHs in the country by restricting recipients to Social Welfare Fund beneficiary HHs in 3 eligible districts in Al Hodeidah governorate: Marawi'ah, Bayt Al Faqiah and Zabid (Kurdi 2019, Introduction \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Program description). Beneficiaries were divided into 2 separate priority groups. Women in the pilot districts who were direct family members of Social Welfare Fund beneficiaries were in the first priority group and were automatically included in the Cash for Nutrition programme (received the intervention). Indirect family members, such as daughters\u00e2\u0080\u0090in\u00e2\u0080\u0090law, of Social Welfare Fund beneficiaries were added to a second priority list. Because the programme was not large enough to include all of these second priority women, inclusion of these indirect family member beneficiaries was randomised at the community level (Kurdi 2019, Sample and Methodology \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Randomization). The primary survey respondent was the woman identified as a second\u00e2\u0080\u0090priority potential beneficiary by the programme, which meant that all respondents were pregnant or mothers of children aged < 2 at the time of the baseline survey (Kurdi 2019, Sample and Methodology \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Survey).

Programme targeted the poorest and the most vulnerable HHs in the country by restricting recipients to Social Welfare Fund beneficiary HHs (Kurdi 2019, Introduction). Because the pilot programme was limited to 4800 beneficiaries, Social Welfare Fund beneficiaries were divided into 2 separate priority groups. Women in the pilot districts who were direct family members of Social Welfare Fund beneficiaries were in the first priority group and were automatically included in the Cash for Nutrition programme (received intervention). Indirect family members, such as daughters\u00e2\u0080\u0090in\u00e2\u0080\u0090law, of Social Welfare Fund beneficiaries were added to a second priority list. Because the programme was not large enough to include all of these second priority women, inclusion of these indirect family member beneficiaries was randomised at the community level (Kurdi 2019, Sample and methodology \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Randomization). The cRCT population consisted of the HHs of these women on the 'second priority list.'Study aim or objective: to measure the impact of the Cash for Nutrition programme on eligible HHs; to describe the degree to which HH characteristics, details of programme implementation and the external environment increased or decreased programme impact; and to describe the functioning of the programme and changes in HH welfare in the current conflict environment.Study period: December 2014 to August 2017Unit of allocation or exposure: HHs\t \tParticipants\tBaseline characteristicsCash for Nutrition InterventionAge: mother mean, years: 27.6 (SD 6.86); mother's age at marriage: mean, years: 17.6 (SD 2.94)Place of residence: NRSex: NREthnicity and language: NROccupation: NREducation: HHs with illiterate mother, %: 79.7SES: Asset Index mean \u00e2\u0080\u00930.1349 (SD 1.768); HHs owning a television, %: 33.6; HHs owning a washing machine, %: 5.9; HH owning livestock, %: 52.3; rooms in house, mean: 1.30 (SD 0.581); people in house, mean: 6.21 (SD 3.54)Social capital: HHs with husband, %: 72.9Nutritional status: mean calories consumed per adult male equivalent mean coefficient: 1820.4 (SD 1081.8); proportion of HHs without enough food in past 7 days: 0.358Morbidities: NRConcomitant or previous care: NRControlAge: mother, mean, years: 28.1 (SD 6.81); mother's age at marriage, mean, years: 17.6 (SD 2.86)Place of residence: NRSex: NREthnicity and language: NROccupation: NREducation: HHs with illiterate mother, %: 73.4SES: Asset Index mean 0.1352 (SD 1.930); HHs owning a television, %: 44.0; HHs owning a washing machine, %: 9.2; HH owning livestock, %: 52.7; rooms in house mean: 1.31 (SD 0.636); people in house mean: 6.50 (SD 3.26)Social capital: HHs with husband, %: 74.6Nutritional status: mean calories consumed per adult male equivalent mean coefficient: 1662.8 (SD 888.9); proportion of HHs without enough food in past 7 days: 0.407Morbidities: NRConcomitant or previous care: NROverall: NRInclusion criteria: for cRCT (not overall Cash for Nutrition programme): residents in 1 of the 3 targeted districts in Al Hodeidah (Marawi'ah, Bayt Al Faqiah or Zabid); mothers of children aged < 2 years and pregnant women; indirect relatives of Social Welfare Fund beneficiariesExclusion criteria: NRPretreatment: intervention HHs had a lower Asset Index mean than control HHs; fewer intervention HHs owned TVs and washing machines compared to controls; and more mothers in intervention HHs were illiterate compared to mothers in control HHs.Attrition per relevant group: at baseline, communities that included indirect relatives of Social Welfare Fund beneficiaries were randomly assigned to the intervention (95 communities, 1001 HHs) or control (95 communities, 999 HHs) groups.

The conditionality of the cash transfers was based on the attendance of the beneficiaries of the programme at nutrition\u00e2\u0080\u0090focused training sessions and compliance with child monitoring and treatment of malnutrition (Kurdi 2019, Executive summary). The monthly sessions covered topics on infant and young child feeding practices, including exclusive breastfeeding, for children aged \u00e2\u0089\u00a4 6 months, complementary feeding for children aged 6\u00e2\u0080\u009324 months, the importance of balanced meals, use of iodised salt, proper hygiene and sanitation, appropriate treatment of drinking water, and treatment of diarrhoea. Additional quarterly sessions targeted pregnant and lactating women and covered breastfeeding initiation, the importance of colostrum and no prelacteal feeds, as well as the consequences of consuming the stimulant qat (Catha edulis), smoking during pregnancy, hygiene and sanitation and treatment of drinking water. Pregnant women were also referred to the nearest health centre for antenatal care. In addition, under Yemen's Social Fund for Development, periodic screening sessions during home visits were carried out to detect and refer cases of malnutrition to health centres for treatment (Kurdi 2019, Introduction). Cash for Nutrition programme beneficiaries were required to attend these sessions and attendance was tracked, although the conditionality was not strictly enforced (Kurdi 2019, Introduction). Second part of the intervention: in the last quarter of 2017 an expanded version of the pilot programme was included in the World Bank funded Yemen Emergency Crisis Response Project.Duration of intervention period: January\u00e2\u0080\u0093December 2015; October 2016 to August 2017Frequency: quarterly transfers during January\u00e2\u0080\u0093December 2015, monthly transfers during October 2016 to August 2017, monthly nutritional training sessions from January\u00e2\u0080\u0093December 2015 and nutritional training sessions for 12 months from October 2016 to August 2017Number of study contacts: surveys completed at baseline (December 2014 to January 2015) and follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up (July\u00e2\u0080\u0093August 2017)Providers: Yemen Social Fund for Development in coordination with the Ministry of Public Health and Population, and the Yemen Emergency Crisis Response Project (funded by the World Bank)Delivery: local women with at least a high school education were selected as community health volunteers and received basic training in health and nutrition education and malnutrition screening. The volunteers were employed to provide monthly educational sessions and monitor the children of participating HHs (Kurdi 2019, Introduction). Data collection for the baseline survey was done by an independent survey organisation, Prodigy, while for the follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up survey the data collection was managed directly by the Social Fund for Development due to the challenges of conducting survey fieldwork during the conflict (Kurdi 2019, Sample and methodology \u00e2\u0080\u0093 survey).Co\u00e2\u0080\u0090interventions: unspecified other food distribution programmes.Resource requirements: transfers of YER 3000 per HH per month for January\u00e2\u0080\u0093December 2015, and YER 10,000 (about USD 30 at the time of conflict) per HH per month for October 2016 to August 2017.

However, direct beneficiaries in all the communities all received the intervention. Therefore, it was not possible (and there does not seem to have been attempts made) to conceal group allocation.\t \tBaseline characteristics similar (Selection bias)\tHigh risk\tIntervention HHs had significantly lower Asset Indices (P = 0.001), and owned significantly fewer televisions (P < 0.01) and washing machines (P = 0.007). Intervention HHs also had a significantly higher percentage of illiterate mothers (P < 0.001).\t \tBaseline outcome measurements similar (Selection bias)\tUnclear risk\tNo formal hypotheses to test baseline outcome values reported.\t \tBlinding of participants and personnel (Performance bias)\tLow risk\tGiven the nature of the study design, it was unlikely that blinding of participants and training volunteers was possible. Some outcomes, such as health and nutrition behaviour and spending on food, may have been prone to performance bias. It was not clear, however, whether participants and volunteers were aware that the survey was recording their behaviour.\t \tBlinding of outcome assessment (Detection bias)\tHigh risk\tIt is NR whether people administering the survey and taking anthropometric measurements were blinded to assignment. It is also unclear whether participants, the outcome assessors for self\u00e2\u0080\u0090reported measures, were blinded.\t \tProtection against contamination (Performance bias)\tHigh risk\tThe authors reported high levels of contamination. During the survey, 16% of intervention HHs reported not receiving the transfer at baseline and 7% at follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up. 23% of control HHs reported receiving the cash transfer at baseline and 24% follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up. It is not clear how large the role of contamination was for non\u00e2\u0080\u0090recipient HHs located close to recipient HHs in the same communities.\t \tIncomplete outcome data (Attrition bias)\tHigh risk\tAttrition 7.5% overall and fairly balanced across intervention (6.59%) and control groups (8.41%). The use of replacement HHs for those who could not be resurveyed at follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up is reported, but it was assumed that these HHs are in addition to those HHs 're surveyed at follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up'. However, 2 entire control clusters were lost.\t \tSelective outcome reporting (Reporting bias)\tUnclear risk\tNo protocol available for review\t \tOther bias\tLow risk\tIncorrect analysis: low risk for SEs for model coefficients clustered at community level; recruitment bias: low risk for recruitment prior to randomisation.

Follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up survey showed that 50% of sampled HHs in the treatment areas said that they ever received PKH. This relatively low PKH coverage rate could partly explain the lack of impact. However, such coverage rates might be due to HHs not really being aware of the various poverty programme cash/subsidy they received (e.g. BLT (UCTs) vs PKH (CCTs) vs BOS (school operational assistance).Co\u00e2\u0080\u0090interventions: NRResource requirements: NREconomic indicators: NRControl characteristics: no intervention\t \tOutcomes\tAnthropometry: underweight (WAZ < \u00e2\u0080\u00932SD); severe underweight (WAZ < \u00e2\u0080\u00933SD); wasting (WHZ < \u00e2\u0080\u00932SD); severe wasting (WHZ < \u00e2\u0080\u00933SD); stunting (HAZ < \u00e2\u0080\u00932SD); severe stunting (HAZ < \u00e2\u0080\u00933SD)\t \tIdentification\tSponsorship source: research fellowship from the Harvard Kennedy School Indonesia Program.Country: IndonesiaSetting: urban very poor HHs (PKH) and rural very poor HHs (Generasi) in West Java, East Java, North Sulawesi, Gorontalo, and East Nusa Tenggara provincesAuthor's name: Dian KusumaEmail: dkusuma@mail.harvard.eduDeclarations of interest: none declared.Study or programme name and acronym: Program Keluarga Harapan (PKH) and Generasi.Type of record: journal articles\t \tNotes\t\u00c2\u00a0\t \tRisk of bias\t \tBias\tAuthors' judgement\tSupport for judgement\t \tRandom sequence generation (Selection bias)\tUnclear risk\tRandom sequence generation method NR.\t \tAllocation concealment (Selection bias)\tUnclear risk\tAllocation concealment methods NR\t \tBaseline characteristics similar (Selection bias)\tLow risk\tNo important differences between groups reported at baseline.\t \tBaseline outcome measurements similar (Selection bias)\tUnclear risk\tAlthough food consumption was similar at baseline, growth outcomes at baseline were NR\t \tBlinding of participants and personnel (Performance bias)\tLow risk\tBlinding of participants and personnel was not possible but unlikely to influence intervention received.\t \tBlinding of outcome assessment (Detection bias)\tLow risk\tUnclear whether outcome assessors were blinded but key outcomes were objective and unlikely to be influenced by lack of blinding.\t \tProtection against contamination (Performance bias)\tLow risk\tAllocation was at subdistrict level, which minimised the risk of spillovers.\t \tIncomplete outcome data (Attrition bias)\tLow risk\tNo attrition was reported.\t \tSelective outcome reporting (Reporting bias)\tUnclear risk\tProtocol N/A.\t \tOther bias\tUnclear risk\tMisclassification of exposure: low risk.

N/ARandomisation ratio: about 1:1Recruitment method: municipalities selected for their extreme levels of poverty and because they had been affected by a severe drought in previous year.Sample size justification and outcome used: NRSampling method: in communities randomly selected to participate in the Atenci\u00c3\u00b3n a Crisis programme, the primary child carer (known as the 'titular'), mainly a woman, was invited to a registration assembly where the programme objectives and various components were explained. At the end of assembly, a lottery took place in each community. Participation in the assemblies and lotteries was close to 100%. Based on lottery, all eligible HHs within each community were assigned to 1 of 3 treatments.Study aim or objective: to analyse the impact of a cash transfer programme on early childhood cognitive development and the extent to which changes in child development could be explained solely by the cash component of the Atenci\u00c3\u00b3n a Crisis programme.Study period: Atenci\u00c3\u00b3n a Crisis pilot programme was implemented between November 2005 and December 2006, Baseline data for the evaluation collected in April\u00e2\u0080\u0093May 2005. A first follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up survey collected in July\u00e2\u0080\u0093August 2006, 9 months after the HHs had started receiving payments.

The eligibility criteria were determined using the proxy means methodology developed for the RPS and based on the national HH data from 2001 (EMNV). Additional discussions with local leaders from each intervention community were conducted to identify possible exclusion or inclusion errors. Based on the discussions with leaders, 3.7% of all the HHs considered were re\u00e2\u0080\u0090assigned from non\u00e2\u0080\u0090eligible to eligible, and 3.7% from eligible to non\u00e2\u0080\u0090eligible. To avoid any possible selection bias resulting from the re\u00e2\u0080\u0090assignment by the leaders, the results they presented use eligibility by the proxy means as the ITT (without taking into account the reclassification by the community leaders).Exclusion criteria: NRPretreatment: children aged 0\u00e2\u0080\u00935 years in the intervention group at baseline were significantly more underweight and received fewer vitamins and deworming drugs in the previous 6 months when compared to those in the control group. Also, in the control compared to the intervention group, HHs had more members aged \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 65 years.Attrition per relevant group: attrition over the study period was minimal, < 1.3% in 2006 and 2.4% in 2008. Attrition is uncorrelated with treatment status, and does not differ across treatment packages. The low attrition rates were a result of repeat visits to recover temporary absence and extensive tracking of migrants. Migrant HHs and children were interviewed and tested in their new locations.Description of subgroups measured and reported: NRTotal number completed and analysed per relevant group: overall: 3326 in 2006 and 4245 in 2008.

First, to serve as a short\u00e2\u0080\u0090term safety net by providing cash transfers to reduce the need for adverse coping mechanisms, such as taking children out of school or reductions in food consumption. Second, to promote long\u00e2\u0080\u0090term upward mobility and poverty reduction by enhancing HHs' asset base and income diversification capacity. There were 3 different intervention groups, all received the same cash transfers (the same amount paid to the child's primary carer every 2 months), but with differing conditionalities or other co\u00e2\u0080\u0090interventions. Group 1: the conditionality of regular health check\u00e2\u0080\u0090ups for children aged 0\u00e2\u0080\u00935 years was not monitored, and thus HHs were not penalised if they did not comply. Group 2: 1 member per HH was offered a scholarship to choose out of a number of vocational training courses at the municipal headquarters. Group 3: HHs were offered a lump sum payment to start a small non\u00e2\u0080\u0090agricultural activity; the lump sum was conditional on developing a business development plan.Duration of intervention period: Atenci\u00c3\u00b3n a Crisis pilot programme was implemented between November 2005 and December 2006.Frequency: bi\u00e2\u0080\u0090monthly cash transfersNumber of study contacts: 3; baseline, first follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up, second follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090upProviders: Ministry of the Family and programme staffDelivery: cash transfers paid every 2 months.

TABLE: Maluccio 2005 TABLE: Study characteristics\t \tMethods\tStudy design: cRCTStudy grouping: parallel groupHow were missing data handled? 90% (1581) of the stratified random sample was interviewed in the first round. In 2002, just over 90% of these were re\u00e2\u0080\u0090interviewed. The sample for which there is a complete set of observations (1 in each of the 3 survey rounds) was 1396, smaller than the 1434 shown in the first row of the third column of Table 3. The HHs were about evenly divided between intervention and control groups, indicating that at least the level of attrition was not significantly different between them. Similarly, when the sample was limited to those interviewed in all 3 rounds as a partial control for attrition bias, estimated effects changed only slightly, with no systematic bias. Another partial remedy to control for attrition bias is to estimate a HH fixed\u00e2\u0080\u0090effects model, particularly if one suspects that unobserved persistent heterogeneity is leading to attrition. However, as with the other robustness checks, when the models were estimated with these controls, the results differed little. The number of HHs was about evenly divided between intervention and control groups, suggesting that attrition was not significantly different between groups. Combining this with the evidence from the robustness checks just described, it was concluded that attrition bias was not driving the results presented.Randomisation ratio: 1:1Recruitment method: NRSample size justification and outcome used: 42 HHs were randomly selected in each comarca using a census carried out by RPS 3 months prior to the survey as the sample frame, yielding an initial target sample of 1764 HHs. The sample size calculation was based on assessing the necessary sample sizes for the indicators listed in Appendix B, Table 26. Assuming a random sample, the indicator that required the largest sample size, using a significance level of 5% and a power of 80%, was enrolment for Grades 1\u00e2\u0080\u00934 (indicator 5 in Appendix B, Table 26). To detect a minimum, statistically significant difference of 8 pps between intervention and control groups, a sample size of 549 students for each group was required. Not all HHs had children in this age group. According to the 2000 RPS population census, 63% of HHs had \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 1 child aged 6\u00e2\u0080\u009312 years. Therefore, to obtain a sample of 549 children (in different HHs), it was necessary to interview 871 HHs in each group (549 divided by 0.63) or 1742 in total. Thus, the study authors arrived at a target sample of 1764 HHs.Sampling method: in the design phase of RPS, rural areas in all 17 departments of Nicaragua were eligible for the programme. In addition, these departments had easy physical access and communication (including being < 1\u00e2\u0080\u0090day drive from the capital, Managua, where RPS is headquartered), relatively strong institutional capacity and local co\u00e2\u0080\u0090ordination, and reasonably good coverage of health posts and schools. By purposively targeting, RPS avoided devoting a disproportionate share of its resources during the pilot to increasing the supply of educational and health services. In the next stage of geographic targeting, all 6 (out of 20) municipalities that had the participatory development programme Microplanificaci\u00c3\u00b3n Participativa (Participatory Micro\u00e2\u0080\u0090planning), run by the national Fondo de Inversi\u00c3\u00b3n Social de Emergencia (FISE), were chosen. In the last stage of geographic targeting, a marginality index based on information from the 1995 National Population and Housing Census was constructed, and an index score was calculated for all 59 rural census comarcas2 in the selected municipalities. The index was a weighted mean of the following set of poverty indicators (with respective weights in parentheses) known to be highly associated with poverty (Arcia 1999): 1. family size (10%), 2. access to potable water (50%), 3. access to latrines (30%), and 4. illiteracy rates (10%). Higher index scores were associated with more impoverished areas. Recognising that the index could not reliably distinguish between 2 comarcas with similar scores, rather than use the scores directly, the 59 rural comarcas were grouped into 4 priority levels after renormalising the highest index score to 100: a score > 85 was given highest priority (priority 1); 70\u00e2\u0080\u009385, priority 2; 60\u00e2\u0080\u009370, priority 3 and below 60, lowest priority. The 42 comarcas with the priority scores 1 and 2 were eligible for the pilot phase's first stage. Comarcas are administrative areas within municipalities that include 1\u00e2\u0080\u00935 small communities averaging 100 HHs each.Study aim or objective: to determine the impact evaluation of a randomised community\u00e2\u0080\u0090based intervention, RPS, against a broad range of outcomes related to the programme's primary objectives, including 1. HH (food) expenditures, 2. child schooling and child labour, 3. preventive health care of children aged < 5 years, and 4. nutritional status of children.Study period: baseline: 2000; follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up: 2001\u00e2\u0080\u00932002Unit of allocation or exposure: randomisation was at the comarca level.

The goal of that programme was to develop the capacity of municipal governments to select, implement and monitor social infrastructure projects such as school and health post construction, with an emphasis on local participation.Inclusion criteria: in the design phase of RPS, rural areas in all 17 departments of Nicaragua were eligible for the programme. The focus on rural areas reflects the distribution of poverty in Nicaragua of the 48% of Nicaraguans designated as poor in 1998, 75% resided in rural areas. For the pilot, the Government of Nicaragua selected the departments of Madriz and Matagalpa from the northern part of the Central Region, on the basis of poverty as well as on their capacity to implement the programme. Table 1 of the publication summarises the eligibility requirements and demand and supply\u00e2\u0080\u0090side benefits of RPS.Exclusion criteria: HH not extremely poor satisfying 1 or both of the following: 1. own a vehicle, truck, pickup truck or jeep; 2. own > 20 manzanas (14.1 hectares) of land. Based on these criteria, 169 HHs (2.9% of HHs living in the intervention areas as reported in the May 2000 RPS census population) were excluded from the programme. In addition to these HHs, 219 (3.8%) HHs were excluded after the orientation assemblies and programme registration for \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 1 of the following reasons: 1. HH comprising a single man or woman who was not disabled, 2. HH with significant economic resources or a business, 3. HH that omitted or falsified information during the RPS population census. Finally, 240 (4.2%) HHs did not attend the orientation assembly or chose not to participate.Pretreatment: there were few significant differences between HHs (or individuals) in intervention and control groups at baseline. Differences in baseline 2000 study: RPS mean effect on annual total HH: intervention: NIO 20,903 control; NIO 20,695 in controlAttrition per relevant group: 90% (1581) of the stratified random sample was interviewed in the first round (see Table 3 of publication). In a few comarcas, the coverage was 100%, but in 6, it was < 80%. For the follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up surveys in October 2001 and October 2002, the target sample was limited to these 1581 first\u00e2\u0080\u0090round interviews. In 2002, just over 90% of these were re\u00e2\u0080\u0090interviewed, on a par with surveys of similar magnitude in other developing countries. Again, however, coverage in 6 of the comarcas was substantially worse, with < 80% successfully re\u00e2\u0080\u0090interviewed (and 1 was 1 of the 6 from above with high first\u00e2\u0080\u0090round non\u00e2\u0080\u0090response rate). This attrition was unlikely to have been random.Description of subgroups measured and reported: Grades 1, 2, 3 and 4; extreme poor, poor and non\u00e2\u0080\u0090poor; children aged 0\u00e2\u0080\u00933 years, 12\u00e2\u0080\u009323 months; HHs with children aged 0\u00e2\u0080\u00935 years; HHs with children aged 7\u00e2\u0080\u009313 years;Total number completed and analysed per relevant group: total completed interview: 1581 in 2000, 1490 in 2001 and 1434 in 2002.

One\u00e2\u0080\u0090half of the 42 comarcas (targeted in the first stage) were randomly selected into the programme. Thus, there are 21 comarcas in the intervention group and 21 in the control group.\t \tInterventions\tIntervention characteristicsIntervention or exposureFood access intervention category: increase buying powerIntervention type: CCTDescription: modelled after PROGRESA, RPS is designed to address both current and future poverty via cash transfers targeted to HHs living in poverty in rural Nicaragua. The transfers were conditional, and HHs were monitored to ensure that children were, among other things, attending school and making visits to preventive healthcare providers. RPSs specific objectives included: supplementing HH income for up to 3 years to increase expenditures on food, reducing school desertion during the first 4 years of primary school, and increasing the health care and nutritional status of children aged < 5 years.Duration of intervention period: 2 yearsFrequency: every other monthNumber of study contacts: 3 (baseline, follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up 2001 and follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up 2002)Providers: IADB loan financing the project and the Government of Nicaragua and RPS provided the service. IFPRI conducted the quantitative impact evaluationDelivery: to ensure adequate supply, RPS trained and paid private providers to deliver the specific healthcare services required by the programme. Cash transfer delivery method NR.Co\u00e2\u0080\u0090interventions: none reportedResource requirements: to ensure adequate supply, RPS trained and paid private providers to deliver the specific healthcare services required by the programme. These services provided free of charge to beneficiary HHs, included growth and development monitoring; vaccination; and provision of antiparasites, vitamins, and iron supplements. The monitoring was done using the MIS designed specifically for and by RPS. It comprises a continuously updated, relational database of beneficiaries, healthcare providers and schools. The MIS is also used to 1. select beneficiaries and prepare invitations to programme incorporation assemblies, 2. calculate transfer payments, 3. compile requests to the Ministry of Health for vaccines and other materials, and 4. monitor whether service providers were meeting their responsibilities. Decision rules capturing the requirements were programmed directly into the MIS. Substantial time was dedicated to designing data forms for the various programme participants that fed into this system (including the HH registry or census forms, school forms, and healthcare provider forms that were all sent to the main office where they were entered into the computer).Economic indicators: RPS comprised 2 phases over 5 years, starting in 2000. The pilot phase (also known as Phase I) lasted 3 years and had a budget of USD 11 million, representing approximately 0.2% of GDP or 2% of annual recurring government spending on health and education. The value of the supply\u00e2\u0080\u0090side services, as measured by how much RPS paid to the providers, was also substantial. On an annual basis, the education workshops cost approximately USD 50 per beneficiary and the health services for children aged < 5 years, approximately USD 110, including the value of the vaccines, antiparasites, vitamins and iron supplements, all of which were provided by the Ministry of Health. To enforce compliance with programme requirements, beneficiaries did not receive the food or education component of the transfer if they failed to carry out any of the conditions.Control: no intervention\t \tOutcomes\tProportion of HH expenditure on food: per capita food expenditure (annual); percentage of HH food expenditure; food expenditure for different food groups/itemsAnthropometry: underweight (WAZ < \u00e2\u0080\u00932SD); stunted (HAZ < 2SD); wasted (WHZ < \u00e2\u0080\u00932SD); HAZ\t \tIdentification\tSponsorship source: IFPRICountry: NicaraguaSetting: 42 rural comarcas areas in rural departments of Madriz and Matagalpa in the northern part of the Central Region in NicaraguaAuthors' names: John A Maluccio and Rafael FloresEmail: NRDeclarations of interest: NRStudy or programme name and acronym: Red de Protecci\u00c3\u00b3n Social (RPS) or 'Social Safety Net'Type of record: report\t \tNotes\t\u00c2\u00a0\t \tRisk of bias\t \tBias\tAuthors' judgement\tSupport for judgement\t \tRandom sequence generation (Selection bias)\tLow risk\tRandomisation done through lottery process. Given the geography of the programme area, control and intervention comarcas were at times adjacent to one another. The selection was done at a public event with representatives from the comarcas, the Government of Nicaragua, IADB, IFPRI and the media present. The 42 comarcas were ordered by their marginality index scores and stratified into 7 groups of 6 each. Within each stratum, randomisation was achieved by blindly drawing 1 of 6 coloured balls (3 blue for intervention, 3 white for control) from a box after the name of each comarca was called out. Thus, 3 comarcas from each group were randomly selected for inclusion in the programme, while the other 3 were selected as controls. The survey sample is a stratified random\u00e2\u0080\u0090sample at the comarca level from all 42 comarcas. The areas represented comprise a relatively poor part of the rural Central Region in Nicaragua, but the sample is not statistically representative of the 6 municipalities (or other areas of Nicaragua, for that matter). 42 HHs were randomly selected in each comarca using a census carried out by RPS 3 months prior to the survey as the sample frame, yielding an initial target sample of 1764 HHs.\t \tAllocation concealment (Selection bias)\tLow risk\tAllocation was at the comarca level at the beginning of the study.

TABLE: Marquis 2018 TABLE: Study characteristics\t \tMethods\tStudy design: cRCTStudy grouping: parallel groupHow were missing data handled? ITT analysisRandomisation ratio: 1:1Recruitment method: 6 Upper Manya Krobo District subdistricts stratified by population size, 3 subdistricts randomly selected as study site, census of communities completed with GPS location of all HHs, 89 communities organised geographically into 16 clusters, within each cluster, communities randomly chosen to reach target number of eligible HHs per cluster, 39 communities selected as study area. Enrolment and intervention implementation carried out in 2 phases: Phase 1 (2014\u00e2\u0080\u00932015): all women with infants who lived in selected communities and planned to remain community for duration of project invited to enrol. Phase 2 (2016\u00e2\u0080\u00932017): age range expanded to target young children < 18 months to include planned sample size \u00e2\u0080\u0093 both phases included additional eligibility criteria. All 277 eligible HHs in selected communities of 8 intervention clusters invited to enrol in Phase 1 (2014). At end of Phase 1, new 95 eligible HHs from same communities identified and invited to enrol in Phase 2 (2016). 2 intervention clusters had no new eligible HHs so 6 intervention clusters were active in Phase 2. 34 eligible HHs were not enrolled, 51 were enrolled, baseline data lost due to malfunction. Control cluster communities with no benefit not enrolled a second time and order of including control clusters randomly assigned. To mimic intervention enrolment, 5 control clusters were used in Phase 1 (135 eligible HHs) and 3 control clusters (114 eligible HHs) in Phase 2. Among control clusters, 36 HHs were not enrolled.Sample size justification and outcome used: sample size calculated with an \u00ce\u00b1 = 0.05, power = 0.80, effect size d = 0.35, and variance inflation factor = 1.79, resulting in 227 HHs/group. Assuming an LTFU of 10%, the sample size estimate was 250 per treatment group or a total of 500 mother\u00e2\u0080\u0093child pairs. Outcome not mentioned.Sampling method: random as communities within clusters were randomly chosen.Study aim or objective: to determine the effect of a 12\u00e2\u0080\u0090month intervention (inputs and training for poultry farming and home gardening, and nutrition and health education) on child diet and nutritional status.Study period: phase 1: 12 months; phase 2: 12 monthsUnit of allocation or exposure: clusters consisting of either 1 distinct community or multiple adjacent small communities.\t \tParticipants\tBaseline characteristicsIntervention or exposureAge: child, mean, months: 10.52 (SD 5.17)Place of residence: NRSex: female children, n (%): 143 (49.8)Ethnicity and language, n (%): mothers of Krobo ethnicity: 217 (76.4); mothers of other ethnicity: 67 (23.6)Occupation: NREducation, n (%): no education 54 (24.5); primary education 100 (45.5); secondary education 66 (30.0)SES, n (%): low HH wealth 92 (33.0); middle HH wealth 95 (34.0); high HH wealth 92 (33.0); raised poultry in past 12 months 140 (48.8)Social capital: NRNutritional status: mean: LAZ: \u00e2\u0080\u00930.88 (SD 1.27); WAZ: \u00e2\u0080\u00930.78 (SD 1.12); WLZ: \u00e2\u0080\u00930.37 (SD 1.08); consumed eggs in previous 24 hours, n (%): 56 (25.3); minimal diverse diet, n (%): 67 (30.9); food secure, n (%): 123 (43.3); mild food insecurity, n (%): 79 (27.8); moderate food insecurity, n (%): 48 (16.9); severe food insecurity, n (%): 34 (12.0)Morbidities: NRConcomitant or previous care: NRControlAge: child mean, months: 10.43 (SD 5.07)Place of residence: NRSex: child female, n (%): 97 (45.5)Ethnicity and language, n (%): mothers of Krobo ethnicity: 161 (77.4); mothers of other ethnicity: 47 (22.6)Occupation: NREducation, n (%): no education 40 (29.2); primary education 89 (42.8); secondary education 79 (38.0)SES, n (%): low HH wealth 70 (33.8); middle HH wealth 67 (32.4); high HH wealth 70 (33.8); raised poultry in past 12 months 114 (53.5)Social capital: NRNutritional status: mean: LAZ: \u00e2\u0080\u00930.78 (SD 1.30); WAZ: \u00e2\u0080\u00930.68 (SD 1.27); WLZ: \u00e2\u0080\u00930.31 (SD 1.24); consumed eggs in previous 24 hours, n (%): 35 (21.5); minimal diverse diet, n (%): 54 (33.8); food secure, n (%): 95 (45.2); mild food insecurity, n (%): 54 (25.7); moderate food insecurity, n (%): 39 (18.6); severe food insecurity, n (%): 22 (10.5)Morbidities: NRConcomitant or previous care: NROverall: NRInclusion criteria: in Phase 1 (2014\u00e2\u0080\u00932015), all women with infants (aged 0\u00e2\u0080\u009312 months) who lived in the selected communities and who planned to remain in the community for the duration of the project were invited to enrol in the trial. In Phase 2 (2016\u00e2\u0080\u00932017), the age range was expanded to target young children aged < 18 months to include the planned sample size. For both phases, additional eligibility criteria for the intervention participants included the timely preparation of a chicken coop that met project specifications and a fenced home garden plot.Exclusion criteria: NRPretreatment: rate for enrolment with baseline completion was lower among the intervention compared with the control clusters, partly due to a malfunction of the electronic data collection system (77.2% intervention vs 83.5% control; P < 0.01). There were no enrolment phase differences in baseline values for the infant anthropometric indices (data not shown). There were no baseline treatment group differences in child, maternal or HH characteristicsAttrition per relevant group: total 14.4%. Total LTFU cases were due to refusal (2), participant moved outside study area (49), and maternal or child death (5). The remaining cases could not be found (16).

Beekeeping was introduced for interested HHs only in Phase 1 for honey harvesting after end of trial. The intervention had 4 main components. 1. Poultry for egg production. Participants received 4 days of intensive training from livestock extension and veterinary officers on a wide variety of topics to build their knowledge and skills in poultry farming. These included 2 days on coop construction using local materials and 2 days on feeding and caring of poultry. During Phase 1, each participant received 40 Swiss Brown chickens at point of lay. The Heifer's POG funds supported the purchase of 30 chickens for each Phase 2 participant. To compensate for the lower number of chickens provided so that women in Phase 2 would have similar income to Phase 1, the POG repayment requirement was reduced by 50%. To assist women with their poultry\u00e2\u0080\u0090based small business, the project facilitated egg sales for women who could not access markets. 2. Home gardens. Project agricultural staff trained participants at the University of Ghana's Nutrition Research and Training Centre and in the communities on vegetable gardening, providing information on site selection, fencing, seedbed preparation, compost preparation and use, and organic weed, insect, and pest control. 3. Group education. Weekly group education sessions were carried out using a curriculum of 12 lessons that was repeated during the year. The lessons emphasised young child diet and health, with special emphasis on diet diversity and consumption of eggs, green leafy vegetables and orange\u00e2\u0080\u0090fleshed sweet potatoes. 4. Community\u00e2\u0080\u0090wide education. The intervention communities received training that was accessible to all residents. The training included a. food demonstration sessions that emphasised the consumption of vegetables promoted for home gardens and eggs, b. mother\u00e2\u0080\u0090to\u00e2\u0080\u0090mother support groups that encouraged optimal child\u00e2\u0080\u0090feeding practices, c. enhanced community\u00e2\u0080\u0090based growth monitoring and promotion, and d. community\u00e2\u0080\u0090wide discussions on gender and diversity.

However, we did not detect any baseline differences by treatment group, and the sensitivity analysis results were consistent with the ITT analysis, suggesting that selection bias was not large enough to affect the results.\" TABLE: Merttens 2013 TABLE: Study characteristics\t \tMethods\tStudy design: cRCTStudy grouping: parallel groupHow were missing data handled? (quote) \"Column 8 shows the number of observations at follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up (FU1) which is 2,867 (the sample of households comprising the treatment plus control panel) minus any missing values.\" Therefore, where there were missing data, the sample size for that outcome was reduced accordingly. Probability of retention was estimated using regression, and weighting of HHs was adjusted by inverse retention probability to adequately represent attrition HHs.Randomisation ratio: 1:1Recruitment method: evaluation covered the 4 former districts of Mandera, Marsabit, Turkana and Wajir, in 12 randomly selected sublocations in each district. The sublocations that were covered by the evaluation were referred to as the evaluation sublocations. The HSNP applied a staggered roll\u00e2\u0080\u0090out, with sublocations being brought into the Programme on a month\u00e2\u0080\u0090by\u00e2\u0080\u0090month basis.Sample size justification and outcome used: calculated based on the expected sampling error for point estimates, differences and DID for key indicators. These key indicators were not explicitly reported. A sample attrition buffer of 10% was factored in to compensate for the high risk of sample attrition.Sampling method: intervention and control HHs were sampled from HSNP administrative records. From these, 66 HHs were sampled from each sublocation using simple random sampling. In the event of non\u00e2\u0080\u0090response, a replacement HH which had not yet been drawn was randomly selected from the administrative record. The sequence in which the sampled evaluation sublocations were targeted and surveyed was determined randomly. The evaluation sublocations were selected from a sample frame of all secure sublocations in each district. The evaluation sublocations were sorted within new districts by population density and paired up, with 1 of the pair being control and 1 being treatment. The reason sublocations were sorted (within each new district) by population density before pairing them up was to ensure that similar sublocations were matched to reduce as far as possible significant variations between the characteristics of the control and treatment groups. For both the treatment and control sublocations there were an equal number of CBT, SP and DR sublocations.Study aim or objective: to evaluate the HSNP programme's impact on consumption expenditure and poverty reduction, food security, and increased asset retention and accumulation. Secondary impacts namely uptake of health and education services, stabilised food prices, supplies of key commodities, diversity of livelihood activities, financial savings, vulnerability to shocks, empowerment of women, and well\u00e2\u0080\u0090being of the young and elderly people were also assessed.Study period: August 2009 to November 2012Unit of allocation or exposure: sublocations (geographical areas within counties)\t \tParticipants\tBaseline characteristicsIntervention or exposureAge: HHs containing \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 1 child aged < 18 years, %: 91.9;

Farmers were provided with 3 years of continuous training and extension support to enable them to become efficient in utilising inputs such as labour, organic fertiliser and capital. The project tested the adoption of integrated aquaculture\u00e2\u0080\u0090agriculture under 2 different models: 1 with the provision of a small financial grant (which was provided for purchasing inputs especially fish seed but also other inputs), and 1 without. The project aimed at improving resource\u00e2\u0080\u0090use efficiency to increase farm\u00e2\u0080\u0090level productivity in a sustainable manner through diffusion of low\u00e2\u0080\u0090cost integrated aquaculture\u00e2\u0080\u0090agriculture approaches suitable for poor farmers with limited resources. Long\u00e2\u0080\u0090term training and close extension support were provided to the project farmers. These farmers received 3 training sessions during the first year, 2 during the second year, and 1 follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up training in the final year. Formal training was complemented by regular informal training sessions, such as group meetings at the pond/plot site using the Participatory Adaptive Learning approach (PAL), and annual participatory evaluation sessions.

Trained field workers explained the study to eligible HHs, and informed consent was obtained from either the HH head or the mother of the selected child.Sample size justification and outcome used: the study was restricted to 55 villages that met minimum programme eligibility criteria in the 4 departments because of logistics and cost. We estimated a sample size of 30 children per cluster with statistical significance of 0.05, power of 0.80 and an intracluster correlation of 0.02. This sample size provided the ability to detect minimum differences between treatment groups of a change of 0.25 in mean HAZ and WHZ and a 0.3 g/dL change in Hb. The sample also permitted the estimation of changes of 10 pps in the prevalence of wasting, anaemia and diarrhoea and 15 pp in stunting.\"Sampling method: before the baseline evaluation, villages within 4 'departments' in the province of Gourma were identified for possible inclusion in the EHFP programme; participating villages needed to have water sources to support production during the dry season. 55/181 eligible villages were identified for randomisation and were stratified by commune/department and village size before randomisation into 1 of 3 groups: 1. control group, which received no interventions from HKI (25 control villages), 2.

Set of agricultural production and nutrition interventions targeted to mothers with children aged 3\u00e2\u0080\u009312 months at baseline. Agricultural production interventions centred on dedicating land to women's production during the secondary agricultural season and distributing inputs and training to increase production and consumption of nutrient\u00e2\u0080\u0090rich foods and to generate additional income (and control over that income) through the sale of surplus production. Programme beneficiaries were provided with saplings, cuttings and seeds of nutrient\u00e2\u0080\u0090rich fruits (e.g. mangoes and papayas) and vegetables (e.g. orange\u00e2\u0080\u0090flesh sweet potatoes, dark green leafy vegetables and carrots) and small gardening tools (e.g. hoes, shovels and watering cans). Beneficiaries were also given chicks to increase production of animal source foods (i.e. eggs and meat from the chickens). In addition, they received training in optimal agriculture and poultry\u00e2\u0080\u0090raising practices to help them establish their homestead food production activities. Nutrition intervention: used a BCC strategy known as the Essential Nutrition Actions framework, which focuses on 7 primary health and nutrition behaviours. Twice a month, all beneficiary mothers were visited in groups or individually by 1 of 2 different types of community volunteers trained by the programme; either OWLs or HC members. This component aimed to improve mothers' own health and nutrition by enabling them to adopt optimal health and nutrition practices for themselves and their young children.Duration of intervention period: NRFrequency: frequency of distribution of productive assets and training regarding agricultural intervention NR.

Differential attrition also occurred by HH size and composition, the presence of polygamy, female\u00e2\u0080\u0090headed HHs and female formal education. Furthermore, women with a higher BMI were more likely to attrite resulting in an attenuation of effect size.\t \tSelective outcome reporting (Reporting bias)\tLow risk\tNo protocol available.

TABLE: Osei 2017 TABLE: Study characteristics\t \tMethods\tStudy design: cRCTStudy grouping: parallel groupHow were missing data handled? Missing or implausible outcome data were reported in the article and were excluded from the analysis involving the respective outcomes variables (Osei 2017). Attrition not relevant as study data were collected through independent cross\u00e2\u0080\u0090sectional surveys at baseline (2009) and follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up (2012). Therefore, data on the impact of the intervention were not gathered from the same individuals in the 2 surveys.Randomisation ratio: 1:1 (subdistrict level)Recruitment method: recruitment to intervention group: not described. 1 woman per group of intervention villages (about 5 or 6) was selected and trained by HKI in improved gardening and poultry\u00e2\u0080\u0090rearing practices in preparation to host a VMF. Under the guidance of HKI, this woman then trained 20 other beneficiary women on how to establish their home gardens and poultry production (Osei 2017).Sample size justification and outcome used: calculated to detect an assumed difference in the prevalence of stunting and underweight of 10% as well as a difference in wasting of 5% among children in the treatment compared to the control communities. Using a power of 0.80, a 95% CI (2 sided), an assumed design effect of 2 and an upward adjustment of 10% to account for LTFU, 1970 children were considered adequate for each of the pre\u00e2\u0080\u0090 and post\u00e2\u0080\u0090treatment surveys. The baseline sample was increased to 2106 to allow enough participants for a substudy, which involved providing micronutrient powders to a subsample of 110 children in the intervention communities for 6 months. The follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up sample was also increased to 2614 to allow sufficient participants for disaggregated analysis (Osei 2017)Sampling method: multistage cRCT. The Baitadi district is administratively divided into 12 subdistricts called 'Ilakas', and each 'Ilaka' is further divided into 'village development committees' (VDCs), which consist of several (about 9) villages. (Osei 2015). Assigned Ilakas (instead of villages or HHs) into each of the 2 study groups. Ilakas were paired on several key socioeconomic indicators, and 4 of the generated 6 pairs of Ilakas were selected for inclusion in study using a simple random sampling procedure. The same procedure was followed to assign 1 Ilaka in each pair as the treatment group and the other as the control. Overall, there were 21 VDCs in the treatment Ilaka and 20 in the control Ilakas (Osei 2017). All the VDCs in the EHFP programme communities received the EHFP intervention. To select families for the pre\u00e2\u0080\u0090 and postsurveys, VDCs were stratified by treatment (21) or control group (20), and 14 VDCs were selected from each using a simple random sampling procedure to participate in the surveys. However, all the VDCs in the EHFP programme communities received the EHFP intervention, regardless of their participation in the surveys. Within each selected VDC, HHs were selected using the probability proportional to size technique, and in each selected HH, a child aged 12\u00e2\u0080\u009348 months was chosen together with his/her mother for the assessments. If a HH had > 1 eligible child, the youngest child was chosen (Osei 2017).Study aim or objective: to determine the effect of an EHFP programme consisting of home garden, poultry raising and nutrition education implemented over 2.5 years vs control (no intervention) on anthropometry and anaemia among children (aged 12\u00e2\u0080\u009348 months) and their mothers (Osei 2017).Study period: 2.5 years from 2009 to 2012.

Children in the intervention group were significantly older than those in the control group at follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up. Other characteristics that were similar among the study groups at baseline but differed significantly at follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up included the proportion of HHs with no monthly cash income and those with some financial debts at the time of the surveys. Both surveys showed significantly fewer mothers with no formal education, mothers who worked outside the home, and proportion of families with married HH heads, in the upper caste and lower tercile of wealth among the treatment compared to the control group.Attrition per relevant group: attrition not relevant as baseline and follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up samples were independent. NR. Authors reported data excluded from analysis. Of the 2106 mother\u00e2\u0080\u0093child pairs in the baseline sample, 1 child and 2 mothers missed Hb measurements; 8 children had implausible HAZ and 4 children had implausible WHZ values, and 1 mother had implausible BMI (< 12.0 kg/m2). Therefore, these participants were excluded from the analysis involving these outcomes. In addition, 10.9% of the mothers (intervention: 100; control: 129) were pregnant at baseline and were excluded from maternal BMI and underweight analysis. For the 2614 mother\u00e2\u0080\u0093child pairs assessed at follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up, 18 had implausible HAZ and 11 children had implausible WHZ values, and 9.7% mothers (intervention: 125; control: 128) were pregnant.

Under the guidance of HKI, this woman then trained 20 other beneficiary women on how to establish their home gardens and poultry production. Altogether, the project intended to establish 120 VMFs, each of which served as a site for purchasing inputs and ongoing training for all the beneficiary women. For every season (rainy and winter) of the first year, each woman was given a one\u00e2\u0080\u0090off free supply of seeds, saplings and locally bred chicks to establish their home gardens and poultry production. Throughout the intervention, the women met monthly at the VMF to refresh lessons on agriculture techniques and nutrition through social and BCCs, such as optimal infant and young child feeding practices, cooking demonstrations on how to use the EHFP produce to enrich family meals, and participation in routine public health services (immunisation, growth monitoring, vitamin A supplementation and deworming) offered in their communities. The intervention activities were jointly monitored through monthly home visits by trained project staff, female community health volunteers, and agriculture extension officers. During each home visit, the project staff and agriculture extension officers observed the home gardens and poultry, including the number of different varieties of crops cultivated, whether the garden was fenced, how many of poultry birds the family had, whether the poultry had started laying eggs, etc., and provided advice on any garden or poultry issues the family was facing. On these home visits, the project staff and the female community health volunteers also reinforced the educational messages on breastfeeding and complementary feeding to all mothers (Osei 2017).Duration of intervention period: 2.5 years: 2009\u00e2\u0080\u00932012Frequency: For every season (rainy and winter) of the first year, each woman was given a one\u00e2\u0080\u0090off free supply of seeds, saplings and locally bred chicks to establish their home gardens and poultry production.

HHs with \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 5 children LSL 750 quarterlyDuration of intervention period: 24 months. HHs enrolled in July and August 2011 and the first payments started in September 2011.

However, payments were not made as scheduled; payment schedule was unpredictable and the transfers were made in more irregular disbursements than expected. Based on the administrative records, the mean number of payments received per CGP beneficiary HH in the sample was 6 to 7, while based on the operational design, the intended number of quarterly payments should have been 8.Number of study contacts: 2.

NRRandomisation ratio: N/ARecruitment method: NRSample size justification and outcome used: NRSampling method: used the data set from the Young Lives Ethiopia survey, which offers rich child and HH level panel information for 2 cohorts (born 1994 and 2001), including siblings, which allows study authors to evaluate programme impacts of different age groups from 5 years to 15 years. The Young Lives Ethiopia was a longitudinal cohort study conducted over 3 waves (2002, 2007 and 2009\u00e2\u0080\u00932010). This data set included HHs selected for the PSNP programme and others that were not; and this was identified through survey questionnaire questions. The PSNP combines geographic and community\u00e2\u0080\u0090based targeting to identify chronically food\u00e2\u0080\u0090insecure HHs. Many communities had public meetings to discuss the shortlist for potential beneficiaries of PSNP, which was then approved by the next level of administration. Due to budget constraints, some HHs were short listed, but did not receive the programme. The sample comprised data from 20 sentinel sites chosen in 5 regions. HHs within sites were chosen randomly among those that had children born in the stipulated year. Importantly, PSNP was operating in 15 of these sites with 530/1886 HHs (29.1% of the sample) active beneficiaries of the programme.Study aim or objective: to provide transfers to the food insecure population' and to 'bridge the food gap' (Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, 2004). It operates as a safety net, whereby the public works (also known as cash/food for\u00e2\u0080\u0090work, or workfare) programme operates seasonally, but predictably (and similarly for the direct support, or UCT).Study period: introduced in 2005 and is still ongoing.Unit of allocation or exposure: HHs\t \tParticipants\tBaseline characteristicsIntervention or exposure group: NRControl: NROverall: NRInclusion criteria: targeting criteria for PSNP: HHs were food insecure and had been receiving food aid in the past.Exclusion criteria: NRPretreatment: NRAttrition per relevant group: NR.

The PSNP was designed to provide predictable support for selected HHs over several years. The programme has a principle paying in cash rather than food, with the ratio of cash/food in 2008 at 60/40, and the daily wage rate was ETB 8 in 2008 (USD 0.56).Duration of intervention period: 2005 to ongoingFrequency: public works (also known as cash/food for\u00e2\u0080\u0090work, or workfare) programme operates seasonally but predictably (and similarly for the direct support, or UCT)Number of study contacts: 3; 2002, 2007, 2009\u00e2\u0080\u00932010Providers: Ethiopian governmentDelivery: PSNP, centrally co\u00e2\u0080\u0090ordinated by GovernmentCo\u00e2\u0080\u0090interventions: NRResource requirements: NREconomic indicators: the annual donor financed budget is approximately USD 347 million (about 1.2% of Ethiopia's GDP).

Unclear how much data were excluded due to this. No other missing/excluded data reported but according to table 4, data were missing for 10/3000 originally enrolled HHs (7 in intervention group; 3 in control group; both at baseline and follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up for each).Randomisation ratio: N/ARecruitment method: NRSample size justification and outcome used: sample size calculation was primarily to detect meaningful levels of change in the study outcomes compared to the comparison group. Planned to sample only 1 child per HH, hence an equal sample size of 750 HHs at baseline and 750 at follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up was obtained in the intervention (1500) as well as the control area (1500). This sample size was adequate to show a 10% effect size for stunting (primary outcome) among children aged < 5 years at 6 years follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up (32.9% in the intervention vs 40% in the control) with > 80% power and 5% significance level (2\u00e2\u0080\u0090sided test), a design effect of 2% and 5% sampling error. The sample size allowed for a 10% non\u00e2\u0080\u0090response rate. The sample size was adequately powered to detect a 6% effect size in the prevalence of wasting at 6\u00e2\u0080\u0090year follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up and to model associations between outcome and intervention, adjusted for demographics and other variables.Sampling method: the surveys were conducted using a 2\u00e2\u0080\u0090stage cluster sampling method. The first stage involved identifying clusters (wards) within each district to be included in the study. All wards in each district were listed separately in alphabetical order by VDC. Using the 2011 population census data for each ward (cluster), a cumulative population for all wards was computed. From this cumulative list, the required number of clusters in each district was determined using the probability proportional to size sampling method. In the second stage, HHs within the selected clusters were identified for inclusion in the study. A list of HHs in each selected ward was constructed with the help of the local leaders and UNICEF staff. From the list, a HH was selected using a systematic sampling approach. Only HHs with \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 1 child aged < 60 months were eligible for the study. The sampling interval (X) was determined by dividing the total number of HHs in each ward with the expected sample size, and the first HH to be surveyed was randomly selected by choosing a number between 1 and X. For each selected HH, mothers/caretakers of children aged < 5 years volunteered to take part in the surveys, and the interview occurred outside the home, away from other HH members. If the selected HH was not inhabited, or there was no\u00e2\u0080\u0090one at home, the closest neighbouring HH was used for the survey. Sampled about 30 HHs per cluster in each selected district at baseline, midline and endline surveys. For clusters where the number of HHs was < 25, the selected ward and its adjoining neighbour were merged and treated as a single cluster. In HHs with > 1 child, only 1 child was randomly selected for enumeration.Study aim or objective: to evaluate the effectiveness of the synergetic effect of child sensitive social protection programmes, augmented by a capacity building for social protection and embedded within existing government's TRTs for families on child nutritional status.Study period: 6 years: October\u00e2\u0080\u0093December 2009 (pre) to December 2014\u00e2\u0080\u0093February 2015 (post)Unit of allocation or exposure: district\t \tParticipants\tBaseline characteristicsIntervention or exposureAge: child, mean, months: 28.66 (SD 15.36)Place of residence: NRSex: proportion of girls: 44.8% (SD 49.8%); boys: 55.2% (SD 49.8%)Ethnicity and language: ethnicity proportion: disadvantaged ethnic groups: 1.5% (SD 12.0%); Dalit Hill/Terai: 21.3% (SD 41.0%); upper caste group: 77.2% (SD 42.0%)Occupation: NREducation: proportion of fathers with primary education or less: 2.1% (SD 14.5%); secondary level education: 33.1% (SD 47.1%); intermediate or higher education: 64.8% (SD 47.8%).

The CCG provides NPR 200 per month for up to 2 children for poor families with children aged < 5 years in Karnali Zone (Kalikot, Jumla, Mugu, Humla and Dolpa) to complement existing social protection schemes for senior citizens, single women, endangered communities and people with disabilities. The Government of Nepal's CCG is an UCT scheme in which allowances are provided to all eligible HHs. The CCG programme has been supported and enhanced by the capacity building for social protection implemented by a UNICEF/Nepal partnership programme, whose aim has been to design and implement complementary interventions, partly funded by the Asian Development Bank through Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (Table 1). The capacity building for social protection had 4 major components: 1. capacity development of central and local government officials; 2. system development for effective implementation and monitoring of child grant; 3. linking the child grant with nutrition; and 4. grant management, monitoring and audit. The Ministry of Federal Affairs and Local Development (the main executing agency) was responsible for the system development component and the Asia Development Bank together with the Ministry of Federal Affairs and Local Development and the Ministry of Health and Population were responsible for grant management component. (Table 1 of publication for all programme activities).Duration of intervention period: 6 yearsFrequency: assessments were completed and outcome measures recorded pre\u00e2\u0080\u0090 (October\u00e2\u0080\u0093December 2009) and post\u00e2\u0080\u0090 (December 2014 to February 2015) intervention. Distribution of child grants to all children aged < 5 years were done every 4 months (3 times a year). In addition, the intervention group had multiple contacts with study partners, including 1. capacity building activities to enhance capacity of local bodies to deliver the child grant, 2. network enhancing activities aimed at improving child nutrition, 3. social BCC on child nutrition, 4. awareness raising activities for timely birth registration to identify all eligible HHs and about the availability of the CCG, 5. assisting mothers/carers to identify the best possible locally available food and encouraging use of cash grant for nutritious foods and the improvement of nutritional status of children, 6. improving the knowledge and skills of CCG beneficiaries in the areas of infant and young child feeding practices, hygiene, sanitation and other key behaviours linked to child nutrition.Number of study contacts: multiple.

UNICEF was responsible for implementation of the capacity development and linking CCG with nutrition and supported the Government of Nepal's (Ministry of Federal Affairs and Local Development and Ministry of Health and Population) in implementing key strategies underpinning the intervention.Delivery: the CCG programme was administered and paid for by the Government of Nepal and supported and enhanced by capacity building for social protection implemented by a UNICEF/Nepal partnership programme. UNICEF was responsible for implementation of the capacity development and linking CCGs with nutrition and supported the Government of Nepal (Ministry of Federal Affairs and Local Development and Ministry of Health and Population) in implementing key strategies underpinning the intervention (training, workshops, group meetings, radio messages, campaigns, technical support). The Ministry of Federal Affairs and Local Development (the main executing agency) was responsible for the system development component and the Asia Development Bank together with the Ministry of Federal Affairs and Local Development and the Ministry of Health and Population were responsible for grant management component. The capacity building component was partly funded by the Asian Development Bank through Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction. The intervention was embedded within existing universal social transfer programmes hence ensuring continuity of participation and preventing the disruption in disbursements. The implementation of the intervention involved too many stakeholders with differing expectations and competing objectives, which might have hampered the effective implementation of the project. This challenge was overcome by having clear role and responsibilities and a focal co\u00e2\u0080\u0090ordinating committee overseen by the Government of Nepal.Co\u00e2\u0080\u0090interventions: TRTsResource requirements: NREconomic indicators: NRControlFood access intervention category: increase buying power (weaker)Intervention type: government TRTs for familiesDescription: government's funded TRTs for families.

Authors reported that data were analysed as ITT. However, due to discrepancies in timing of implementation of the interventions in both groups, with the food group receiving the last instalment 15 days before the endline survey whereas in the cash group the transfer was received 49 days before, some HHs were excluded from the analysis: for outcomes that rely on a recall period including the week before the survey (e.g. days in the last 7 the HH consumed meat), the analysis excluded those HHs that received their transfer in the 8\u00e2\u0080\u0090day period before the survey. Other data were also excluded. This analysis conducted throughout this report was restricted to 3353 treatment and comparison HHs for whom consistent data from both the baseline and endline surveys exists. In addition, the remaining HHs not considered here had extensive incomplete, missing or unreliable data for key sections.Randomisation ratio: 1:1. The 136 FDPs within the sample area were randomised into equal numbers of cash or food transfers.Recruitment method: NR. Initial meetings with beneficiaries were held in June 2011 before the first transfer of the 2011 cycle was distributed to sensitise beneficiaries to the programme objectives and logistics. A follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up meeting for cash beneficiaries was held in November 2011 during the first disbursement of cash transfers.Sample size justification and outcome used: NR. Based on the distribution of clusters in the treatment groups and the required sample sizes, 15 intervention HHs and 11 non\u00e2\u0080\u0090beneficiary HHs were randomly selected to be interviewed in each FDP. In total, 3536 HHs were included in the baseline sample. Approximate sample size calculations were conducted across countries at the inception of the study and are found in Ahmed et al. (2010). (Note: we were unable to find this reference.)Sampling method: 14 governorates were chosen to implement the ESN based on the classifications of \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 10% of the population as severely food insecure, with the end objective of reaching \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 75% of this population at the governorate level. The governorates of Hajjah and Ibb were chosen to be the sites of the cash and voucher pilot based on several criteria. These governorates are second\u00e2\u0080\u0090 and third\u00e2\u0080\u0090ranked among the 14 governorates implementing the ESN in terms of absolute numbers of food\u00e2\u0080\u0090insecure people. In addition, Hajjah and Ibb had high percentages of the food\u00e2\u0080\u0090insecure (Hajjah: 46.3% and Ibb: 44.0%, according to the 2009 CFSS), as well as relative stability and implementation feasibility (WFP\u00e2\u0080\u0090CO Yemen 2011a). The 136 FDPs within the sample area were randomised into equal numbers of cash or food transfers. Taking into consideration the context of the project area, the study authors stratified the randomisation of clusters at the governorate level due to the distinct socioeconomic and geographic characteristics of Hajjah and Ibb. Based on the distribution of clusters in the treatment groups and the required sample sizes, 15 intervention HHs and 11 non\u00e2\u0080\u0090beneficiary HHs were randomly selected to be interviewed in each FDP. In total, 3536 HHs were included in the baseline sample. Unclear who the non\u00e2\u0080\u0090beneficiary HHs were; they were not mentioned elsewhere.Study aim or objective: in order to provide rigorous evidence on the relative impact and cost\u00e2\u0080\u0090effectiveness of cash and food transfers, the study authors analysed the results of a cRCT of a seasonal safety net programme implemented by the WFP in rural Yemen. The analysis focused on the relative effectiveness of food and cash transfers. The analysis focused primarily on the differential impacts of these transfer types on food security outcomes.Study period: 7 months. Start and end date of study not clearly reported but it started sometime in 2011, with the first cash disbursement in November 2011. Initial meetings with beneficiaries were held in June 2011 before the first transfer of 2011. A follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up meeting for cash beneficiaries was held in November 2011 during the first disbursement of cash transfers.Unit of allocation or exposure: clusters; FDPs (villages)\t \tParticipants\tBaseline characteristicsIntervention or exposureAge: HH head, mean, years: 47.59.

In addition, Hajjah and Ibb have high percentages of food\u00e2\u0080\u0090insecure people (Hajjah 46.3% and Ibb 44.0%, according to the 2009 CFSS), as well as relative stability and implementation feasibility (WFP\u00e2\u0080\u0090CO Yemen 2011a).Exclusion criteria: NRPretreatment: comparing the food and cash treatment groups, the randomisation appeared to function reasonably well. In terms of HH demographics, food HHs appeared relatively more likely to be headed by females and singles, although the education levels of the HH head did not significantly differ. In terms of assets, cash HHs appeared to be slightly more likely to have more telephones and own their plot of land, and they had a Wealth Index Level 0.09 SDs higher than food HHs. These differences were relatively small in magnitude, but significant at the 10% level, implying that controlling for baseline SES in the main analysis would improve the accuracy of estimated treatment effects. Note: the baseline characteristics below were taken from Table 2. (Table 3 could also have been chosen: subsample only. However, text with respect to Table 3 seemed not in line with what is represented in Table 3.) Furthermore, comparisons of means of key outcome variables at baseline were only presented for treatment (food and cash) vs comparison.Attrition per relevant group: data for 183 HHs excluded from analysis (5% of baseline sample): of the 183 HHs in the original sampling frame not included in this analysis, only 26 were omitted due to pure attrition. These 26 HHs had moved away from their location during the baseline survey, and were unable to be interviewed for the endline survey. The majority of these HHs originally resided in the Al\u00e2\u0080\u0090Wahdah FDP in Hajjah, and were forced to move due to ongoing tribal violence, but these HHs were not included because multiple beneficiaries lived in the same HH. The remaining HHs not considered here had extensive incomplete, missing or unreliable data for key sections. Attrition per group was NR. Furthermore, for outcomes that relied on a recall period including the week before the survey (e.g. days in the last 7 the HH consumed meat), the analysis excluded those HHs that received their transfer in the 8\u00e2\u0080\u0090day period before the survey. However, they stated that as a whole, the summary statistics did not suggest that selecting the subsample of food HHs who received the transfers > 8 days from survey time introduces discernible bias into the analysis.Description of subgroups measured and reported: dietary diversity in infants and young children: aged 6\u00e2\u0080\u009323 months and 24\u00e2\u0080\u009359 monthsTotal number completed and analysed per relevant group: 1581 HHs analysed.

The bi\u00e2\u0080\u0090monthly food ration to cover this gap for a mean HH size of 7 people is 50 kg of wheat flour and 5.0 L of vegetable oil.Duration of intervention period: 7 months. However, the timing of transfers/disbursements was not the same in both groups. The first food disbursement began in August prior to the baseline survey, and the second transfer began in late October. The final transfer, however, did not occur until April.Frequency: transfer every 2 monthsNumber of study contacts: 2; baseline and endline surveys of both beneficiaries and those with proxy mean scores just above the qualifying threshold were conducted in all clusters.Providers: HH\u00e2\u0080\u0090level transfers were distributed in co\u00e2\u0080\u0090ordination with local partners: the Ministry of Education (MoE) in the case of food transfers. Transfers were given out at district branches of the PPSC in each governorate (see Annexe 1, PPSC branches in Hajjah and Ibb).Delivery: the food transfers were stored in warehouses outside of Sana'a and distributed through local government\u00e2\u0080\u0090run primary schools with the assistance of a FDC (see Annexe 2, FDPs in Hajjah and Ibb). The FDC is comprised of approximately 3 individuals per FDP including a school teacher from each primary school, a local council administrator and a guard. Each individual beneficiary held an WFP ration card containing a unique ID number, photograph, and other identifying information, and presented the card at the time of transfer pickup. Because beneficiaries may not always have been able to travel due to physical disability or other reasons, other family members can collect transfers on behalf of the beneficiary if they have the ration card, national ID of the beneficiary and self\u00e2\u0080\u0090identification. Initial meetings with beneficiaries were held in June 2011 before the first transfer of the 2011 cycle was distributed to sensitise beneficiaries to the programme objectives and logistics.Co\u00e2\u0080\u0090interventions: NRResource requirements: the FDC is comprised of approximately 3 individuals per FDP including a school teacher from each primary school, a local council administrator and a guard.Economic indicators: food incurred higher costs for distribution and those costs associated with in\u00e2\u0080\u0090country transport, as well as warehousing and other associated costs for commodity storage. Ocean freight, port operations and other external shipping expenses were excluded from this analysis. However, internal transportation and labour costs were included to accurately reflect the cost of food distribution in country. Cash modality was less expensive per beneficiary (USD 162.65) than the food modality (USD 181.49). These costs included beneficiary verification and the cost of the transfers itself during the 3\u00e2\u0080\u0090cycle intervention period. On a per\u00e2\u0080\u0090transfer basis (Figure 3), excluding the cost of the transfer, the modality\u00e2\u0080\u0090specific cost of cash (USD 4.09) was approximately half as expensive compared to food (USD 10.37). Incorporation of the beneficiary cost to collect transfer raised the per\u00e2\u0080\u0090transfer cost (excluding the value of the transfer) of cash to USD 8.22. For food transfers, addition of beneficiary costs raised the per\u00e2\u0080\u0090transfer cost (excluding the transfer value) to USD 11.35. Thus, including the beneficiary costs reduces the per\u00e2\u0080\u0090transfer cost gap from USD 6.28 to USD 3.13.ControlFood access intervention category: increase buying powerIntervention type: UCTDescription: HHs in cash FDPs received 3 cash transfers of an amount equivalent to the local value of the food basket (about USD 50). The total value of the cash transfer was approximately USD 49 (YER 10,500) per transfer per HH, a figure based on the mean equivalent price of the food ration on local markets. Cash transfer HHs could collect cash at any time up to 25 days after disbursement. In the case of cash transfer FDPs, a second resensitisation campaign was held between 22 and 25 November after funds were transferred to PPSC to reinforce messages from the first campaign.Duration of intervention period: 7 months. However, the timing of transfers/disbursements was not the same in both groups. The first food disbursement began 3 August prior to the baseline survey, and the second transfer began in late October. The final transfer, however, did not occur until April.Frequency: 3 cash transfers; every 2 monthsNumber of study contacts: 2; baseline and endline surveys of both beneficiaries and those with proxy mean scores just above the qualifying threshold were conducted in all clusters.Providers: HH\u00e2\u0080\u0090level transfers are distributed in coordination with local partners: the Yemen PPSC in the case of cash transfers.

A follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up meeting for cash beneficiaries was held in November 2011 during the first disbursement of cash transfers. Cash transfer HHs could collect cash at any time up to 25 days after disbursement.Co\u00e2\u0080\u0090interventions: NRResource requirements: HHs had to invest income in significant travel to receive the cash transfer.Economic indicators: a primary cost driver for cash was the 3% fee of total cash transferred each cycle as incurred by the post office. Cash modality was less expensive per beneficiary (USD 162.65) than the food modality (USD 181.49). These costs included beneficiary verification and the cost of the transfers itself during the 3\u00e2\u0080\u0090cycle intervention period. On a per\u00e2\u0080\u0090transfer basis (Figure 3), excluding the cost of the transfer, the modality specific cost of cash (USD 4.09) was approximately half as expensive as compared to food (USD 10.37). Incorporation of the beneficiary cost to collect transfer raises the per\u00e2\u0080\u0090transfer cost (excluding the value of the transfer) of cash to USD 8.22. For food transfers, addition of beneficiary costs raises the per\u00e2\u0080\u0090transfer cost (excluding the transfer value) to USD 11.35.

In terms of assets, cash HHs did appear to be slightly more likely to have more telephones and own their plot of land, and they have a Wealth Index Level 0.09 SDs higher than food HHs. These differences were relatively small in magnitude, but significant at the 10% level, implying that controlling for baseline SES in the main analysis will improve the accuracy of estimated treatment effects.With respect to the subgroup: comparing those included and those excluded within the food treatment group (Table 3), it becomes clear that while the excluded group was slightly more likely to come from Hajjah, differences in other indicators were generally not significant economically and statistically. The lone exception was that the excluded group had higher motor vehicle ownership rates (5% vs 1%), and slightly higher wealth index levels (not statistically significant).

Ideally, the disbursement schedules should be identical so that differences in impact can be attributed to difference between the modalities rather than differences in seasonal or other environmental factors influencing budgeting and resource flows within the household, or discrepancies in the period between transfer receipt and survey measurement.\"Misclassification bias of exposure: low risk.

TABLE: Skoufias 2013 TABLE: Study characteristics\t \tMethods\tStudy design: cRCTStudy grouping: parallelHow were missing data handled? Missing data were excluded from analysis. Sample of HHs used for the analysis of consumption was what remained after dropping HHs with food consumption < 1 percentile and > 99 percentile of the food distribution in the sample. An additional 802 HHs were excluded from the analysis because of missing or incomplete data (Leroy 2010). Analyses provide an estimate of ITT effect of in\u00e2\u0080\u0090kind and cash transfers.Randomisation ratio: 1:1:1:1Recruitment method: NRSample size justification and outcome used: sample size was calculated so that statistical tests had the power to detect statistically significant and biologically relevant differences in several nutritional and economic variables. Specifically, the calculations of the sample size prior to the baseline survey were based on 60 communities per treatment group, a power of 80%, and a minimum detectable difference in food per capita consumption between each treatment and control group of 17.8%. The final sample consisted of 33 HHs per community and around 52 communities per treatment group (ICC 0.220) (Skoufias 2013).Sampling method: 2\u00e2\u0080\u0090stage random sampling. A random sample of 208 rural communities was drawn from a pool of communities within 8 of the poorest states in the Southeast region. Within each community, 33 HHs were selected using systematic random sampling. After baseline data collection, the 208 selected communities (6687 HHs) were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 study groups: food basket without education (52 communities, 1657 HHs), food basket with education (52 communities, 1680 HHs), cash transfer with education (53 communities, 1687 communities) or control (51 communities, 1663 HHs). Due to partial contamination of the original evaluation design the analysis pools both in\u00e2\u0080\u0090kind/food basket groups.Study aim or objective: to examine the impacts of cash and in\u00e2\u0080\u0090kind transfers on HH welfare as measured by food and total consumption, poverty and labour supply (Skoufias 2008; 2013). To estimate the programme's impact on HH energy and macro\u00e2\u0080\u0090 and micronutrient consumption and to evaluate whether the cash and in\u00e2\u0080\u0090kind transfers had a differential effect on these outcomes (LeRoy 2010).Study period: delivery of the PAL benefits began in June 2004 and the mean time of exposure to the availability of the programme transfers was 14 months.Unit of allocation or exposure: communities\t \tParticipants\tBaseline characteristicsIntervention (cash transfer)Age: NRPlace of residence: NRSex: NREthnicity and language: NROccupation: NREducation: NRSES: mean total HH expenditure (per AE per month), n = 1492: MXN 551.6 (SD 336.5)Social capital: NRNutritional status: mean dietary intake (per AE per day), n = 1492: total energy (kcal) 2776.8 (SD 1172.2); energy from fruits and vegetables (kcal): 79.7 (SD 70.5); energy from cereals and legumes (kcal): 1723.7 (SD 916.5); energy from animal source food (kcal): 261.7 (SD 214.0); energy from processed food (kcal): 664 (SD 344.1)Morbidities: NRConcomitant or previous care: NRControlAge: NRPlace of residence: NRSex: NREthnicity and language: NROccupation: NREducation: NRSES: mean total HH expenditure (per AE per month), n = 1384: MXN 571.3 (SD 352.3)Social capital: NRNutritional status: mean dietary intake (per AE per day), n = 1384: total energy (kcal): 2702 (SD 1140.3); energy from fruits and vegetables (kcal): 81.8 (SD 73.6); energy from cereals and legumes (kcal): 1625.3 (SD 838.9); energy from animal source food (kcal): 278.1 (SD 229.6)Morbidities: NRConcomitant or previous care: NROverallAge: NRPlace of residence: NRSex: NREthnicity and language: NROccupation: NREducation: at baseline, about 40% of the HHs heads had completed primary school.SES: families lived in homes with a mean of < 3 rooms.

However, DID analysis accounted for this imbalance. In Leroy 2010, baseline nutrient intakes in cash transfer and control groups were similar.Attrition per relevant group: intervention group (cash transfers with education): 195/1687 (11.6%); control group: 279/1663 (16.8%).

The PAL programme offers nutrition and health education sessions (platicas), as well as participation in programme\u00e2\u0080\u0090related logistic activities. However, attendance was not compulsory. HHs received either a cash transfer of MXN 150/month (equivalent to USD 14 at the time) or a monthly food basket with a cost to the programme of MXN 150. The size of the cash transfer and the amount of food was the same for all HHs regardless of family size or composition. The value of the food basket at local prices was 30% higher for consumers than the actual cost to the programme (Leroy 2010).Duration of intervention period: delivery of the PAL benefits began in June 2004 and the mean time of exposure to the availability of the programme transfers was 14 months.Frequency: every 2 monthsNumber of study contacts: the control and the treatment groups were surveyed on 2 occasions 2 years apart: at baseline in October 2003 to April 2004, and at follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up in October\u00e2\u0080\u0093December 2005.Providers: Mexican government, specifically: benefits were distributed through DICONSA, the related federal programme which distributes non\u00e2\u0080\u0090perishable foods and housekeeping goods throughout rural poor communities.Delivery: distribution of transfers was through DICONSA stores (Mexican government's agency that manages the supply of food). 75% of beneficiaries were women. The value of cash transfer in real terms was smaller than the in\u00e2\u0080\u0090kind transfers.

Monthly allowance of XOF 10,000 (USD 17) was given by mobile phone (offered by the project) to participating HHs. Specifically designated mothers were the primary recipients of the transfer because they were usually in charge of child care.Duration of intervention period: 5 months (July\u00e2\u0080\u0093November) in 2013 and 5 months (July\u00e2\u0080\u0093November) in 2014. These months represent the 'lean season' in Burkina Faso.Frequency: monthlyNumber of study contacts: 9 visits. Baseline data collected 1 month earlier in the intervention group than in the control group in order to enable cash transfer to start on time.

Data collection lasted 29 month (June 2013 to October 2015).Providers: ECHO trained project staffDelivery: a dedicated team supervised and followed up cash transfer activities jointly with the research team. A partnership with a mobile telephone company enabled cash distribution via mobile telephone. Before the intervention, all mothers in the intervention group received an identity card provided by the field teams, a mobile telephone and a subscriber identification module card linked to an electronic account. At the time of distribution, mothers received a text message providing a code and notifying them that their account was credited. Mothers were thus invited to visit cash withdrawal points to collect their money. Presentation of the identity card and the code granted access to the money. Mothers confirmed the cash withdrawal by signing follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up lists. All study participants in the intervention group (100%) received their monthly allowance within 1 week. Operational constraints such as mothers' limited knowledge about the use of mobile telephones, difficulty charging the mobile telephones because of the lack of electricity and low literacy rate among mothers were encountered during the delivery of cash. Sessions demonstrating basic uses of a mobile telephone, home visits by cash transfer supervisors to inform HHs about the scheduled dates for cash transfers, switching subscriber identification module cards from 1 telephone to another at cash withdrawal points, and direct transfers in remote villages were mitigation strategies put in place to tackle these difficulties.Co\u00e2\u0080\u0090interventions: none reported but authors mentioned that a national social protection policy that promotes social transfer mechanisms to the poorest and most vulnerable was adopted in 2012 to enhance food security among the population.Resource requirements: NREconomic indicators: over 1 year, a total of XOF 50,000 (USD 85) was transferred to each eligible HH, representing; 33% of the 2014 national poverty line, estimated at XOF 153,530 (USD 260).ControlFood access intervention category: non\u00e2\u0080\u0090active controlIntervention type: N/ADescription: mothers of children in control group did not receive a cash grant.

In addition, Houngbe 2017 reported that adjustment had been done for important prognostic covariates.\t \tBaseline outcome measurements similar (Selection bias)\tLow risk\tChildren in intervention group were more likely to be wasted. No morbidity outcomes measured at baseline.

Morbidity outcomes were recalled by mothers and these could have been influenced by knowledge of treatment allocation.\t \tProtection against contamination (Performance bias)\tLow risk\tAllocation was by village and it was unlikely that control villages received treatment. Given the cluster randomised design of the study combined with poor and very poor participants who likely did not travel to other villages often, the risk of contamination was not judged to be appreciable.\t \tIncomplete outcome data (Attrition bias)\tLow risk\tAttrition was not high: 99/1278 (7.8%) children enrolled LTFU, due to either death or leaving the study area. 57/644 (8.9%) children in intervention group and 42/634 (6.6%) children in control group LTFU from visits 1 to 9. Data from children with < 2 measurements were excluded: 14 (2.2%) children in intervention group (2.2%) and 14 (2.2%) children in control group were excluded.\t \tSelective outcome reporting (Reporting bias)\tHigh risk\tSome morbidity outcomes reported in the protocol were NR in published paper (oedema and measles).\t \tOther bias\tUnclear risk\tMisclassification bias: unlikely. Measurement bias: unlikely. Incorrect analysis: unclear. Adjusted for clustering. Poisson regression model adjusted for clustering by village, household and child. The payment ('compensations') for the time control participants spent on the study may have resulted in volunteer bias, which may have altered effect sizes. Furthermore, the payment in itself was not meaningfully different from the intervention (though no values were specified) and may have influenced outcomes as well. TABLE: Verbowski 2018 TABLE: Study characteristics\t \tMethods\tStudy design: cRCTStudy grouping: parallel groupHow were missing data handled? In 9 cases, the participant who had been enrolled at baseline was N/A at the time of data collection; so another adult female HH member of the appropriate age completed the 24\u00e2\u0080\u0090hour recall. When nutrient values were N/A for protein, fat, iron, zinc, calcium, vitamin A, thiamine or riboflavin, values were imputed from USDA food composition equivalents, based on values per 100 g by weight (USDA 2016). Given the high attrition rates, instead of estimating missing data using multiple imputation, study authors employed the direct maximum likelihood method to account for the missing values at 22 months, which uses each respondent's available data to compute the likelihood function. The overall likelihood was the product of 2 factors: 1 computed for those respondents with missing data on some variables and 1 for those with complete data on all variables. Parameter estimation and SEs were derived from maximising the overall likelihood function.Randomisation ratio: 1:1:1Recruitment method: among the eligible villages (190, which were those not already participating in other development programmes), random selection was used to identify 90 villages to participate in the study.Sample size justification and outcome used: number of clusters and HHs within each cluster was estimated based on the proportion of anaemic women and children, with 80% power and an a priori significant level of 0.025, to account for multiple comparisons. Assuming a 50% prevalence of anaemia and an interclass correlation of 0.05, a sample size of 300 for each group provided 80% power to detect a 15% absolute reduction in the prevalence of anaemia.Sampling method: with randomised villages, purposive sampling was used to identify 10 HHs per village to participate. Half of the participants (5/10 HHs within each cluster) were randomly selected to complete endline dietary assessment.Study aim or objective: to examine the effect of EHFP with or without aquaculture on dietary intake and prevalence of inadequate intake of select nutrients among women and children living in rural Cambodia, compared to controls.Study period: July 2012 to June 2014, a 22\u00e2\u0080\u0090month periodUnit of allocation or exposure: villages\t \tParticipants\tBaseline characteristicsEHFP + aquacultureAge, mean: women, years: 29.4 (SD 6.3); children, months: 24.2 (SD 15.0)Place of residence: NRSex: adults were all women; sex of children, n %: 167 boys (55.7)Ethnicity and language: NROccupation: NREducation: women's schooling, mean, years: 3.8 (SD 3.0)SES: Wealth Index quintiles, n (%): lowest: 49 (16.3); middle: 67 (22.3); highest: 68 (22.7); HH size, mean: 4.6 (SD 1.5)Social capital: NRNutritional status: women, n (%): underweight: 40 (14.2); anaemia: 110 (39.0).

Therefore, these were included in the multivariable models as potential confounders.Attrition per relevant group: EHFP + aquaculture group: 7 women and 7 children LTFU; EHFP group: 4 women and 4 children LTFU; control group: 10 women and 10 children LTFU. The overall HH attrition rate was 16.2% (146), which did not differ across groups (P = 0.74), but attrition for women overall was higher (38.6%, 348), mainly due to employment\u00e2\u0080\u0090related temporary migration. Primary outcome data were available for 179 (control), 185 (EHFP) and 188 (EHFP + aquaculture) women and 232 (control), 255 (EHFP) and 245 (EHFP + aquaculture) children. Venous blood samples were successfully obtained from 88% of the subset of 450 women at 22 months. LTFU for the venous blood draw was higher among women in control group (22.0%, 33) than in the EHFP (6.7%, 10) and EHFP + aquaculture (6.0%, 9) groups.Description of subgroups measured and reported: only a subgroup of participants measured and analysed per group: of the 10 HHs per village, only 5 per group were randomly selected to be assessed for dietary intake outcomes and analysed as such. Of these, further subgroups (43 woman\u00e2\u0080\u0093child pairs for EHFP + aquaculture group; 45 woman\u00e2\u0080\u0093child pairs for EHFP group; 46 woman\u00e2\u0080\u0093child pairs for the control group) were selected to do a repeat dietary intake assessment on a non\u00e2\u0080\u0090consecutive day.Total number completed and analysed per relevant group: EHFP + aquaculture group: 143 women and 142 children analysed; EHFP group: 146 women and 144 children analysed; control group: 140 women and 135 children analysed.Total number enrolled per relevant group: each group had 30 villages randomly assigned to them, and from each village 10 HHs were enrolled, which provided per group: 300 HHs, 300 women (of which 150 women's venous blood samples were taken), 300 childrenTotal number randomised per relevant group: see above\t \tInterventions\tIntervention characteristicsEHFP + aquacultureFood access intervention category: increasing buying powerIntervention type: income generationDescription: basic agricultural inputs and training, and nutrition and hygiene education.

METHODS: Differences between protocol and review METHODS: Although we aimed to follow the methods prespecified in our protocol (Durao 2015), we implemented some necessary changes to methods as we worked on the review. The changes and the reasons for them are detailed below. METHODS: We had specified in the protocol that we would include non\u00e2\u0080\u0090randomised studies including controlled before\u00e2\u0080\u0090after studies (CBAs) and prospective analytical cohort studies. However, after identification of eligible studies, it was difficult to clearly identify the distinction between these two study designs; in both study designs, observations are made before and after an intervention has been implemented or an exposure has occurred, both in an intervention and a control group. They also have similar issues regarding potential biases due to using non\u00e2\u0080\u0090randomised methods, such as selection bias. Therefore, we made a pragmatic decision to keep these studies in the same category, namely 'prospective controlled studies'. METHODS: A number of databases proposed in the protocol were removed from the initial search in 2016, as they were redundant, the content was not relevant or we did not have access to the databases. They are listed below, with reasons: METHODS: Cochrane Public Health Group Specialized Register: included in CENTRAL; METHODS: African Index Medicus: included in African Healthline; METHODS: CINAHL (via EBSCOhost), PsycINFO: not relevant to the topic; METHODS: Food Science and Technology Abstracts, CAB Abstracts: no access. METHODS: After the evaluating the 2016 search results regarding number of relevant and eligible articles retrieved by each database, the following databases were omitted from the 2019 update of the search: METHODS: Embase (Elsevier); METHODS: GreenFILE (EBSCO); METHODS: AfricaBib (africabib.org); METHODS: AGRIS; METHODS: AGRICOLA; METHODS: AFRICAN HEALTHLINE, African Journals Online (via Africa\u00e2\u0080\u0090Wide Information, EBSCO); METHODS: Trials Register of Promoting Health Interventions (TRoPHI); METHODS: WHO Global Index Medicus; METHODS: International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS) (ProQuest); METHODS: ClinicalTrials.gov. METHODS: In the protocol, we had planned to also search the top five journals in which the included studies are most frequently published and to contact the authors of included studies and undertake citation tracking of these studies, as well as handsearch reference lists of identified relevant systematic reviews. These additional steps to identify studies were not undertaken. Our search of electronic databases was very comprehensive and already retrieved a very large yield to screen. This made it unfeasible to handsearch individual journals. The electronic database search included grey literature databases and we found many reports from organisations working in this field, that are not from peer\u00e2\u0080\u0090reviewed journals. Therefore, we considered that the results retrieved from the search conducted was likely to identify all relevant articles. METHODS: We had planned that one review author would initially screen the first batch of search results for obviously irrelevant titles, as a way to manage the large number of results expected. This was not done as, after the initial search was revised, the number of records retrieved were manageable for duplicate screening. METHODS: We had planned to search the reference lists of the included studies for other relevant studies, and to search for unpublished studies in the grey literature database OpenGREY and on websites of relevant organisations, such as Eldis, International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), World Bank, Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN) and Science Development Net. However, given that electronic database searches already included sources of unpublished literature, and given the very high number of search results, we decided not to search these databases. It is important to note that results from the electronic database searching did retrieve reports published by the World Bank and IFPRI, for example, therefore, we believe we have not missed important studies by not carrying out this additional searching of grey literature databases or websites of relevant organisations. METHODS: We had planned to contact experts working in various areas related to food security for relevant studies. However, given the number of results retrieved, of both published and unpublished studies, we did not think it was necessary to carry this out. We did contact authors of included studies, who sometimes sent other papers linked to a study identified through the search strategy. METHODS: We had planned to meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analyse as our main synthesis method. Due to unavailability of relevant data from many studies we had to use other synthesis methods, namely vote counting based on effect direction. METHODS: We added a clarification that we also excluded interventions where food was provided in the form of food baskets or in\u00e2\u0080\u0090kind transfers of food. These types of interventions, according to our logic model, fall under the groups of interventions addressing availability and were, therefore, excluded. METHODS: We used a definition (that was not included in the protocol) for overall risk of bias to facilitate decisions for downgrading the evidence during our GRADE assessment. We also selected the key outcomes for the GRADE 'Summary of findings' tables after the protocol was published. AUTH_CONT: Contributions of authors AUTH_CONT: SD initiated the review idea with support from BK. AUTH_CONT: SD drafted the review and all other authors contributed to finalise it.

    "Title": "Community\u00e2\u0080\u0090level interventions for improving access to food in low\u00e2\u0080\u0090 and middle\u00e2\u0080\u0090income countries",
    "Abstract": "Abstract Background After decades of decline since 2005, the global prevalence of undernourishment reverted and since 2015 has\u00c2\u00a0increased to levels seen in 2010 to 2011. The prevalence is highest in low\u00e2\u0080\u0090 and middle\u00e2\u0080\u0090income countries (LMICs), especially Africa and Asia. Food insecurity and associated undernutrition detrimentally affect health and socioeconomic development in the short and long term, for individuals, including children, and societies. Physical and economic access to food is crucial to ensure food security. Community\u00e2\u0080\u0090level interventions could be important to increase access to food in LMICs. Objectives To determine the effects of community\u00e2\u0080\u0090level interventions that aim to improve access to nutritious food in LMICs, for both the whole community and for disadvantaged or at\u00e2\u0080\u0090risk individuals or groups within a community, such as infants, children and women; elderly, poor or unemployed people; or minority groups. Search methods We searched for relevant studies in 16 electronic databases, including trial registries, from 1980 to September 2019, and updated the searches in six key databases in February 2020. We applied no language or publication status limits. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster randomised controlled trials (cRCTs) and prospective controlled studies (PCS). All population groups, adults and children, living in communities in LMICs exposed to community\u00e2\u0080\u0090level interventions aiming to improve food access were eligible for inclusion. We excluded studies that only included participants with specific diseases or conditions (e.g. severely malnourished children). Eligible interventions were broadly categorised into those that improved buying power (e.g. create income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation opportunities, cash transfer schemes); addressed food prices (e.g. vouchers and subsidies); addressed infrastructure and transport that affected physical access to food outlets; addressed the social environment and provided social support (e.g. social support from family, neighbours or government). Data collection and analysis Two authors independently screened\u00c2\u00a0titles and abstracts, and full texts of potentially eligible records, against the inclusion criteria. Disagreements were resolved through discussion or arbitration by a third author, if necessary. For each included study, two authors independently extracted data and a third author arbitrated disagreements. However, the outcome data were extracted by one author and checked by a biostatistician. We assessed risk of bias\u00c2\u00a0for all studies using the Effective Practice and Organization of Care (EPOC) risk of bias tool for studies with a separate control group. We conducted meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analyses if there was a minimum of two studies for interventions within the same category, reporting the same outcome measure and these were sufficiently homogeneous. Where we were able to meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analyse, we used the random\u00e2\u0080\u0090effects model to incorporate any existing heterogeneity. Where we were unable to conduct meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analyses, we synthesised using vote counting based on effect direction. Main results We included 59 studies, including 214 to 169,485 participants, and 300 to 124, 644 households, mostly from Africa and Latin America, addressing the following six intervention types (three studies assessed two different types of interventions). Interventions that improved buying power: Unconditional cash transfers (UCTs) (16 cRCTs, two RCTs, three PCSs): we found high\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence that UCTs improve food security and make little or no difference to cognitive function and development and low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence that UCTs may increase dietary diversity and may reduce stunting. The evidence was very uncertain about the effects of UCTs on the proportion of household expenditure on food, and on wasting. Regarding adverse outcomes, evidence from one trial indicates that UCTs reduce the proportion of infants who are overweight. Conditional cash transfers (CCTs) (nine cRCTs, five PCSs): we found high\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence that CCTs result in little to no difference in the proportion of household expenditure on food and that they slightly improve cognitive function in children; moderate\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence that CCTs probably slightly improve dietary diversity and low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence that they may make little to no difference to stunting or wasting. Evidence on adverse outcomes (two PCSs) shows that CCTs make no difference to the proportion of overweight children. Income generation interventions (six cRCTs, 11 PCSs): we found moderate\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence that income generation interventions probably make little or no difference to stunting or wasting; and low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence that they may result in little to no difference to food security or that they may improve dietary diversity in children, but not for households. Interventions that addressed food prices: Food vouchers (three cRCTs, one RCT): we found moderate\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence that food vouchers probably reduce stunting; and low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence that that they may improve dietary diversity slightly, and may result in little to no difference in wasting. Food and nutrition subsidies (one cRCT, three PCSs): we found low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence that food and nutrition subsidies may improve dietary diversity among school children. The evidence is very uncertain about the effects on household expenditure on healthy foods as a proportion of total expenditure on food (very low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence). Interventions that addressed the social environment: Social support interventions (one cRCT, one PCS): we found moderate\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence that community grants probably make little or no difference to wasting; low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence that they may make little or no difference to stunting. The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of village savings and loans on food security and dietary diversity. None of the included studies addressed the intervention category of infrastructure changes. In addition, none of the studies reported on one of the primary outcomes of this review, namely prevalence of undernourishment. Authors' conclusions The body of evidence indicates that UCTs can improve food security. Income generation interventions do not seem to make a difference for food security, but the evidence is unclear for the other interventions. CCTs, UCTs, interventions\u00c2\u00a0that help generate income, interventions that help minimise impact of food prices through food vouchers and subsidies can potentially improve dietary diversity. UCTs and food vouchers may have a potential impact on reducing stunting, but CCTs, income generation interventions or social environment interventions do not seem to make a difference on wasting or stunting. CCTs seem to positively impact cognitive function and development, but not UCTs, which may be due to school attendance, healthcare visits and other conditionalities associated with CCTs. Plain language summary Improving access to food in low\u00e2\u0080\u0090 and middle\u00e2\u0080\u0090income countries Review question We looked at the effect of community\u00e2\u0080\u0090level interventions to improve access to nutritious food in low\u00e2\u0080\u0090 and middle\u00e2\u0080\u0090income countries (LMICs) on people, households and communities. Background Food security exists when people have physical, social and economic access to sufficient, safe, nutritious foods to be healthy. The number of people who do not have enough to eat in the world has started increasing since 2015. Most of these people live in LMICs, especially in Asia and Africa. Not being able to access nutritious food, either because of not having enough money or because of not having somewhere to shop or find food near where people live, affects the health and socioeconomic situation of people and societies, both in the short and long term. Strategies focusing on communities may be important for increasing access to food in LMICs. Study characteristics We found 59 studies assessing different interventions in LMICs, including 214 to 169,485 participants and 300 to 124,644 households, mainly in Africa and Latin America. Many studies assessed cash transfers, which are welfare programmes where money is provided to households. Of these, 21 studies evaluated unconditional cash transfers, where there are no conditions for receiving the money, and 14 studies assessed conditional cash transfers, where there are specific conditions required to meet in order to receive the money. Seventeen studies looked at income generation interventions (for example, livestock management or self\u00e2\u0080\u0090help groups), four studies at food vouchers, four studies at providing food and nutrition subsidies, and two studies looked at social support interventions such as village savings and loans and community grant programmes. Search date The evidence is current to February 2020. Key results Interventions that improved buying power: Unconditional cash transfers improve food security and make little or no difference to cognitive function (thoughts and understanding) and development (high\u00e2\u0080\u0090quality evidence), may increase dietary diversity (variety of the foods that people or households eat from different food groups) and reduce stunting (poor growth) (low\u00e2\u0080\u0090quality evidence). It is very uncertain whether UCTs reduce the proportion of household expenditure on food and reduce wasting. Regarding adverse outcomes, evidence from one trial indicates that UCTs reduce the proportion of infants who are overweight. Conditional cash transfers make little to no difference in the proportion of household expenditure on food and slightly improve cognitive function in children (high\u00e2\u0080\u0090quality evidence), probably slightly improve dietary diversity (moderate\u00e2\u0080\u0090quality evidence), and may make little to no difference to stunting or wasting (low bodyweight) (low\u00e2\u0080\u0090quality evidence). Evidence on adverse outcomes (two studies) shows that CCTs make no difference to the proportion of overweight children. Income generation strategies make little or no difference to stunting or wasting (moderate\u00e2\u0080\u0090quality evidence), may result in little to no difference to food security and may improve dietary diversity in children but not for households (low\u00e2\u0080\u0090quality evidence). Interventions that addressed food prices: Food vouchers probably reduce stunting (moderate\u00e2\u0080\u0090quality evidence), may slightly improve dietary diversity and may result in little to no difference in wasting (low\u00e2\u0080\u0090quality evidence). Food and nutrition subsidies may improve dietary diversity among school children (low\u00e2\u0080\u0090quality evidence). We are very uncertain about the effects on household expenditure on healthy foods as a proportion of total expenditure on food (very low\u00e2\u0080\u0090quality evidence). Interventions that addressed the social environment: Social support interventions such as community grants probably make little to no difference to wasting (moderate\u00e2\u0080\u0090quality evidence) and may make little or no difference to stunting (low\u00e2\u0080\u0090quality evidence). We are very uncertain about the effects of village savings and loans on food security or dietary diversity (very low\u00e2\u0080\u0090quality evidence). None of the included studies addressed the intervention category of infrastructure changes and none of the included studies reported on one of the primary outcomes: prevalence of undernourishment. Some limitations of the review include not having all necessary information about what was measured (outcomes), judgements that had to be made regarding which outcome measures to report and inability to pool the results of all studies reporting on the same outcome. Another limitation was that we were unable to find out what specific intervention features enable or impede the effective implementation of the intervention.",
    "RESULTS": "Summary of findings Results Description of studies Results of the search We screened titles and abstracts of 15,477 deduplicated records identified through searching electronic databases and reference searching of eligible studies. Of these, we assessed the full texts of 463 records against the eligibility criteria. After assessing available full\u00e2\u0080\u0090texts, we included 59 studies reported in 116 records in this review. Some interventions were reported in more than one study, and two records each reported on two different studies. Of the remaining records: we placed 39 studies under awaiting classification as we could not access them or they were conference abstracts, 11 studies are still ongoing and we excluded 297 records with reasons. In the Characteristics of excluded studies table, we report a subset of key excluded studies. The study selection process is described in Figure 2. Included studies We included 59 studies in this review (Table 9). In this section we provide a summary overview of included studies. More details are provided in the results of interventions section, for studies included in each comparison, and in the Characteristics of included studies table. Study design, sample size and follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up Of the 59 studies included: 36 were RCTs: six with individual or household level randomisation (Baird 2013; Daidone 2014; Gangopadhyay 2015; Haushofer 2013; Jensen 2011; Macours 2012), and 30 with cluster/group randomisation (Ahmed 2019a; Ahmed 2019b; Asfaw 2014; Beegle 2017; Brugh 2018; Chen 2019; Darrouzet Nardi 2016; Evans 2014; Fenn 2015; Fernald 2011; Gertler 2000 (PROGRESA); Hidrobo 2014; Hjelm 2017; Hoddinott 2013; Kandpal 2016; Kurdi 2019; Kusuma 2017b; Kusuma 2017a; Maluccio 2005; Marquis 2018; Merttens 2013; Miller 2011; Olney 2016; Osei 2017; Pellerano 2014; Ponce 2017; Schwab 2013; Skoufias 2013; Tonguet Papucci 2015; Verbowski 2018); 23 were PCS (Aguero 2006; Alaofe 2016; Alaofe 2019; Andaleeb 2016; Andersen 2015; Asadullah 2015; Breisinger 2018; Brunie 2014; Chakrabarti 2018; Doocy 2017; Ferre 2014; Huerta 2006 (PROGRESA); Jodlowski 2016; Kangmennaang 2017; Katz 2001; Kennedy 1989; Leroy 2008 (PROGRESA); Lopez Arana 2016; Murshed E Jahan 2011; Porter 2016; Renzaho 2017; Sturm 2013; Weinhardt 2017). Huerta 2006 (PROGRESA) is a nested study of the PROGRESA cluster\u00e2\u0080\u0090RCT (Gertler 2000 (PROGRESA)). It is important to note that three studies, of different design, evaluated the same programme: PROGRESA (Gertler 2000 (PROGRESA); Huerta 2006 (PROGRESA); Leroy 2008 (PROGRESA)) (Table 10). In addition, two studies assessed the effects of a programme in Malawi in different study settings (Miller 2011; Brugh 2018), whereas two studies reported the effects of an income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation intervention during different periods (Alaofe 2016; Alaofe 2019). All studies had a control group. Most studies compared the intervention with a control group where there was no intervention implemented, six studies compared the intervention with another food security\u00e2\u0080\u0090related intervention (Andaleeb 2016; Chakrabarti 2018; Gangopadhyay 2015; Hoddinott 2013; Renzaho 2017; Schwab 2013), and one study compared the intervention with another intervention unrelated to food security (Weinhardt 2017). Four studies had three intervention groups (Chen 2019;Gangopadhyay 2015;Ponce 2017; Verbowski 2018 ), four studies had four intervention groups (Brunie 2014; Fenn 2015; Hidrobo 2014; Skoufias 2013), and two studies had five intervention arms (Ahmed 2019a; Ahmed 2019b). In all but three cases the study groups were either not relevant for the review or they pertained to different comparisons, therefore, there were no issues with overlapping control groups. For three studies with two relevant intervention arms, these were combined. In some studies, the control group received the intervention at a later stage; this review only captured data for the period during which the control group was not yet receiving the intervention. The unit of allocation or exposure to the intervention was at group level in 41 studies (including communities, electoral divisions, municipalities, parishes, districts, villages, other), at household level in 14 studies (Alaofe 2016; Andersen 2015; Asadullah 2015; Gangopadhyay 2015; Haushofer 2013; Huerta 2006 (PROGRESA); Jensen 2011; Jodlowski 2016; Kennedy 1989; Kurdi 2019; Leroy 2008 (PROGRESA); Macours 2012; Porter 2016; Sturm 2013), and individual level in four studies (including individuals, women, and children) (Aguero 2006; Baird 2013; Katz 2001; Murshed E Jahan 2011). The sample size in included studies ranged from 214 to 169,485 participants and 300 to 124,644 households. All studies collected data on individual participants except for Sturm 2013, which collected supermarket sales data. Maximum follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up was three months in one study (Hoddinott 2013), greater than three months to 12 months in 10 studies (Alaofe 2016; Alaofe 2019; Chen 2019; Fenn 2015; Gangopadhyay 2015; Hidrobo 2014; Jensen 2011; Miller 2011; Ponce 2017; Schwab 2013), greater than 12 months to two years in 25 studies, greater than two years to five years in 17 studies (Asfaw 2014; Baird 2013; Beegle 2017; Breisinger 2018; Brunie 2014; Chakrabarti 2018; Doocy 2017; Evans 2014;Hjelm 2017; Kurdi 2019; Lopez Arana 2016; Macours 2012; Murshed E Jahan 2011; Osei 2017; Sturm 2013; Tonguet Papucci 2015; Weinhardt 2017), and greater than five years to nine years in six studies (Aguero 2006; Andaleeb 2016; Andersen 2015; Asadullah 2015; Porter 2016; Renzaho 2017). Interventions Included interventions were classified according to the categories of interventions in our logic model (Figure 1; Table 8). See Table 9 for a summary of categories and types of interventions included in this review. Fifty\u00e2\u0080\u0090two studies assessed interventions aimed at increasing buying power, including: unconditional cash transfers (18 RCTs: Ahmed 2019a; Ahmed 2019b; Asfaw 2014; Baird 2013; Brugh 2018; Daidone 2014; Fenn 2015; Fernald 2011; Gangopadhyay 2015; Haushofer 2013; Hjelm 2017; Hoddinott 2013; Merttens 2013; Miller 2011; Pellerano 2014; Schwab 2013; Skoufias 2013; Tonguet Papucci 2015; three PCS: Aguero 2006; Breisinger 2018; Renzaho 2017), and conditional cash transfers (nine RCTs: Baird 2013; Evans 2014; Gertler 2000 (PROGRESA); Hidrobo 2014; Kandpal 2016; Kurdi 2019; Kusuma 2017a; Macours 2012; Maluccio 2005; five PCS: Andersen 2015; Ferre 2014; Huerta 2006 (PROGRESA); Leroy 2008 (PROGRESA); Lopez Arana 2016), and interventions to generate income (six RCTs: Beegle 2017; Darrouzet Nardi 2016; Marquis 2018; Olney 2016; Osei 2017; Verbowski 2018; 11 PCS: Alaofe 2016; Alaofe 2019; Asadullah 2015; Doocy 2017; Jodlowski 2016; Kangmennaang 2017; Katz 2001; Kennedy 1989; Murshed E Jahan 2011; Porter 2016; Weinhardt 2017). Under the income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation category, each individual study assessed different types of interventions, including agricultural programmes, livestock transfer programmes or community\u00e2\u0080\u0090based programmes) (Table 11). Eight studies assessed interventions addressing food prices: four RCTs evaluated the effects of food vouchers (Fenn 2015; Hidrobo 2014; Jensen 2011; Ponce 2017); one cRCT (Chen 2019) and three PCS (Sturm 2013; Andaleeb 2016; Chakrabarti 2018) evaluated the effects of food and nutrition subsidies. Two studies assessed social environment interventions: one cRCT (Kusuma 2017b) and one PCS (Brunie 2014) evaluated an intervention addressing the social environment, namely the effects of village savings and loans (VSL) and community grants. Some studies assessed more than one type or category of intervention. Hidrobo 2014 and Fenn 2015 included a group for a CCT and another for food vouchers. Baird 2013 included two groups for conditional and unconditional cash transfers. Porter 2016 assessed a public works intervention providing either cash or food for work, or an UCT. Participants Twenty\u00e2\u0080\u0090five studies included children or households in which children lived. Of these, five studies included households with children under 18 months of age (Andersen 2015; Fernald 2011; Marquis 2018; Olney 2016; Tonguet Papucci 2015); 10 studies included households with children under six years of age (Ahmed 2019a; Ahmed 2019b; Alaofe 2019; Daidone 2014; Fenn 2015; Kennedy 1989; Kurdi 2019; Osei 2017; Renzaho 2017; Verbowski 2018), and six with children under 18 years of age (Chen 2019; Kandpal 2016; Kusuma 2017b; Kusuma 2017a; Lopez Arana 2016; Pellerano 2014); three included households with children, without specifying their age (Aguero 2006; Asfaw 2014; Huerta 2006 (PROGRESA)). Baird 2013 included girls 13 to 22 years of age who had never married. Five studies included adults; in one study, these were members of a healthcare plan (Sturm 2013), one included farmers (Murshed E Jahan 2011), one include men and women (Doocy 2017), and three studies included only women and their respective households (Alaofe 2016; Alaofe 2019; Katz 2001). Twenty\u00e2\u0080\u0090nine studies included households without specifying the inclusion of children (Andaleeb 2016; Asadullah 2015; Beegle 2017; Breisinger 2018; Brugh 2018; Brunie 2014; Chakrabarti 2018; Darrouzet Nardi 2016; Evans 2014; Ferre 2014; Gangopadhyay 2015; Gertler 2000 (PROGRESA); Haushofer 2013; Hidrobo 2014; Hjelm 2017; Hoddinott 2013; Jensen 2011; Jodlowski 2016; Kangmennaang 2017; Leroy 2008 (PROGRESA); Macours 2012; Maluccio 2005; Merttens 2013; Miller 2011; Ponce 2017; Porter 2016; Schwab 2013; Skoufias 2013; Weinhardt 2017). We extracted information from included studies on the following PROGRESS\u00e2\u0080\u0090Plus characteristics: age, place of residence, sex, ethnicity and language, occupation, education, socioeconomic status and social capital, where this was available. There was considerable variation in the reporting of these characteristics. Most studies (48/59) reported on an aspect of socioeconomic status, with 38 studies on age, 37 on sex, 34 on place of residence, 32 on education, 17 on ethnicity and language, 16 studies on occupation and 13 studies on social capital. Setting and context Most included studies were conducted in Africa (27): one each in Egypt (Breisinger 2018), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (Doocy 2017), Ghana (Marquis 2018), Ethiopia (Porter 2016), Lesotho (Pellerano 2014), Mozambique (Brunie 2014), Niger (Hoddinott 2013), and Tanzania (Evans 2014); two each in Benin (Alaofe 2016; Alaofe 2019), Burkina Faso (Olney 2016; Tonguet Papucci 2015), and South Africa (Aguero 2006; Sturm 2013); three in Zambia (Daidone 2014; Jodlowski 2016; Hjelm 2017); four in Kenya (Asfaw 2014; Haushofer 2013; Kennedy 1989; Merttens 2013); six in Malawi (Baird 2013; Beegle 2017; Brugh 2018; Kangmennaang 2017; Miller 2011; Weinhardt 2017). Nineteen included studies were conducted in Asia: five in Bangladesh (Ahmed 2019a; Ahmed 2019b; Asadullah 2015; Ferre 2014; Murshed E Jahan 2011); four in Nepal (Darrouzet Nardi 2016; Katz 2001; Osei 2017; Renzaho 2017); three in India (Andaleeb 2016; Chakrabarti 2018; Gangopadhyay 2015) and two in China (Jensen 2011; Chen 2019), Indonesia (Kusuma 2017b; Kusuma 2017a); and one each in Cambodia (Verbowski 2018), Pakistan (Fenn 2015), and Philippines (Kandpal 2016). Five included studies were conducted in South America: one each in Colombia (Lopez Arana 2016) and Peru (Andersen 2015), and three in Ecuador (Fernald 2011; Hidrobo 2014; Ponce 2017). Two studies were conducted in Nicaragua, Central America (Macours 2012; Maluccio 2005), and four studies took place in Mexico, North America (Gertler 2000 (PROGRESA); Huerta 2006 (PROGRESA); Leroy 2008 (PROGRESA); Skoufias 2013). Two studies were conducted in Yemen, Middle East (Kurdi 2019; Schwab 2013). All studies specifically targeted poor communities or households except two; one that included data from supermarkets in urban areas in South Africa (Sturm 2013), and one that targeted children enrolled in elementary schools in rural China (Chen 2019). Of those targeting communities, 24 studies did not specify the type of communities, 29 included rural communities, including farming communities, and four included urban communities. Outcome measures No included study assessed the primary outcome, namely the prevalence of undernourishment (i.e. people with insufficient food intake to meet their dietary requirements). Eleven studies reported household expenditure on food (Alaofe 2016; Asfaw 2014; Brugh 2018; Ferre 2014; Hjelm 2017; Kennedy 1989; Macours 2012; Maluccio 2005; Merttens 2013; Miller 2011; Sturm 2013). Household expenditure was reported using different units, for example, household food expenditure per day, week or month; or as a proportion of total weekly or monthly household expenditure. One of these studies reported sales data, including the ratio of expenditure on healthy foods, on fruits and vegetables and on less desirable foods, compared to the total food expenditure (Sturm 2013). Food security was reported as food security indices and\u00c2\u00a0dietary diversity measures. Thirteen studies reported food security outcomes using measures such as the proportion of participants experiencing food security or food deficit always, of households consuming more than one meal per day, Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS) and Food Security Index (FSI) (Asadullah 2015; Beegle 2017; Brugh 2018; Brunie 2014; Daidone 2014; Doocy 2017; Haushofer 2013; Hjelm 2017; Kangmennaang 2017; Miller 2011; Osei 2017; Pellerano 2014; Weinhardt 2017). Twenty\u00e2\u0080\u0090four studies reported on dietary diversity using a variety of measures including individual and Household Dietary Diversity Scores (HDDS), Food Consumption Scores (FCS), minimum dietary diversity (MDD) or minimum acceptable food consumption (Ahmed 2019a; Ahmed 2019b; Alaofe 2019; Asfaw 2014; Beegle 2017; Breisinger 2018; Brugh 2018; Brunie 2014; Chen 2019; Daidone 2014; Darrouzet Nardi 2016; Doocy 2017; Ferre 2014; Hidrobo 2014; Jodlowski 2016; Kurdi 2019; Marquis 2018; Merttens 2013; Miller 2011; Olney 2016; Pellerano 2014; Ponce 2017; Skoufias 2013; Tonguet Papucci 2015). Definitions for the food security and dietary diversity measures reported in included studies are provided in Table 12. Six studies reported adequacy of dietary intake (Ahmed 2019a; Ahmed 2019b; Andaleeb 2016; Brugh 2018; Jensen 2011; Kennedy 1989). Measures reported included the proportion of calorie\u00e2\u0080\u0090deficient households and of preschool children meeting caloric requirements; mineral and vitamin sufficiency indices; calorie\u00e2\u0080\u0090deficient households; and ratio of caloric, protein and fat intake to the dietary recommendations. Many studies reported intake in terms of calories or nutrients consumed without relating it to a measure of adequacy; these measures were not reported in this review. A variety of anthropometric measures were reported in included studies. Twenty\u00e2\u0080\u0090seven studies reported on measures of stunting in children (i.e. chronic undernutrition), such as the proportion stunted (HAZ < \u00e2\u0080\u00932 standard deviations (SD)), severely stunted (HAZ < \u00e2\u0080\u00933SD) or mean HAZ (Aguero 2006; Ahmed 2019a; Ahmed 2019b; Andersen 2015; Asfaw 2014; Daidone 2014; Darrouzet Nardi 2016; Doocy 2017; Evans 2014; Fenn 2015; Fernald 2011; Ferre 2014; Kandpal 2016; Kennedy 1989; Kurdi 2019; Kusuma 2017b; Kusuma 2017a; Leroy 2008 (PROGRESA); Lopez Arana 2016; Macours 2012; Maluccio 2005; Marquis 2018; Merttens 2013; Osei 2017; Renzaho 2017; Tonguet Papucci 2015; Verbowski 2018). Twenty studies reported on measures of wasting in children (i.e. acute undernutrition), such the proportion wasted (WHZ < \u00e2\u0080\u00932SD), severely wasted (WHZ < \u00e2\u0080\u00933SD) or mean WHZ (Ahmed 2019a; Ahmed 2019b; Asfaw 2014; Daidone 2014; Evans 2014; Fenn 2015; Ferre 2014; Kennedy 1989; Kurdi 2019; Kusuma 2017b; Kusuma 2017a; Leroy 2008 (PROGRESA); Lopez Arana 2016; Maluccio 2005; Marquis 2018; Merttens 2013; Osei 2017; Renzaho 2017; Tonguet Papucci 2015; Verbowski 2018). Twenty\u00e2\u0080\u0090seven studies reported on measures of underweight in women and children, including WAZ or the proportion of underweight based on these (i.e. WAZ < \u00e2\u0080\u00932SD), BMI for age or mean BMI, or mid\u00e2\u0080\u0090upper arm circumference (MUAC) (Alaofe 2019; Andersen 2015; Asfaw 2014; Brunie 2014; Chen 2019; Daidone 2014; Darrouzet Nardi 2016; Doocy 2017; Evans 2014; Fenn 2015; Ferre 2014; Kandpal 2016;Katz 2001Kennedy 1989; Kusuma 2017b; Kusuma 2017a; Lopez Arana 2016; Macours 2012; Maluccio 2005; Marquis 2018; Merttens 2013; Olney 2016; Osei 2017; Pellerano 2014; Renzaho 2017; Verbowski 2018; Weinhardt 2017). Six studies reported biochemical outcomes, including haemoglobin in five studies (Chen 2019; Fenn 2015; Fernald 2011; Osei 2017; Verbowski 2018) and vitamin A and iron deficiency in one study (Alaofe 2019). Five studies reported cognitive function and development outcomes using a variety of measures including Ravens Colored Matrixes and other cognitive tests, Early Childhood Development Index, individual cognitive function measures such as language and memory, and grade attainment (Andersen 2015; Baird 2013; Daidone 2014; Fernald 2011; Macours 2012). Definitions for cognitive function and development measures reported in included studies are described in Table 13. Four studies reported mental health outcomes including measures such as depression score, stress, psychological distress and psychological well\u00e2\u0080\u0090being (Baird 2013; Fernald 2011; Haushofer 2013; Hjelm 2017). Seventeen studies reported morbidity outcomes (Ahmed 2019a; Ahmed 2019b; Alaofe 2019; Asadullah 2015; Chen 2019; Daidone 2014; Evans 2014; Fenn 2015; Gertler 2000 (PROGRESA); Kandpal 2016; Kennedy 1989; Macours 2012; Merttens 2013; Osei 2017; Pellerano 2014; Tonguet Papucci 2015; Verbowski 2018). Various measures of morbidity were reported including incidence of respiratory infections, diarrhoea and anaemia; the proportion of participants who were ill in a specified reference period or the number of days or percent of time ill. No studies reported specific adverse events. We had specified that overweight and obesity would be considered adverse events in this review, and three studies reported this outcome in young and older children (Andersen 2015; Lopez Arana 2016; Pellerano 2014); however, not as adverse events per se. Funding and conflicts of Interest Most included studies were funded either by non\u00e2\u0080\u0090profit organisations (including research institutes, world bank, non\u00e2\u0080\u0090government organisations, etc) or governmental/intergovernmental agencies (or both) except for one study that was funded by a for\u00e2\u0080\u0090profit organisation (Elanco Animal Health; Jodlowski 2016). One study did not disclose their funding (Gangopadhyay 2015). Of 59 included studies, 39 did not report on potential conflicts of interest (COI) and 27 did. Of those that reported their COI, all declared that none of the authors had any potential COI. Excluded studies We excluded 297 studies. Of the excluded studies: 152 had an ineligible study design, seven did not have an eligible population or setting, 89 did not address an eligible intervention, 23 did not report on relevant outcomes and 26 were duplicates. A selection of 85 key excluded studies is reported in the Characteristics of excluded studies table. Studies awaiting classification We placed 39 studies awaiting classification because we could not assess their eligibility properly without access to the full text, or they were conference abstracts with insufficient data to include them in the review (see Characteristics of studies awaiting classification table). Ongoing studies We identified two studies that could potentially be included in the review once completed. Eleven studies were identified as ongoing. More details on these studies are available in the Characteristics of ongoing studies table. Risk of bias in included studies See the Characteristics of included studies table for more details for each domain of bias assessed for each study. Figure 3 presents a summary of the judgements per risk of bias items and Figure 4 presents the summary of the risk of bias judgments for each included study. Allocation Risk of selection bias is determined by whether participants were randomly allocated to the intervention groups (random sequence generation) and whether there was no possibility of altering the sequence while allocating participants to the intervention groups (allocation concealment). Of the 36 included RCTs, 14 studies described adequate methods of random sequence generation and were at low risk of selection bias. Five studies described doing this using computer\u00e2\u0080\u0090generated random numbers (Baird 2013; Beegle 2017; Fenn 2015; Marquis 2018; Verbowski 2018), one each used STATA software (Gertler 2000 (PROGRESA)) and a randomisation algorithm (Skoufias 2013), while the remaining seven studies randomised communities through public lottery events (Brugh 2018; Daidone 2014; Macours 2012; Maluccio 2005; Merttens 2013; Pellerano 2014; Tonguet Papucci 2015). Twenty\u00e2\u0080\u0090two studies reported randomising individuals or clusters to intervention groups, but did not report how the random sequence had been generated and thus were at unclear risk of selection bias (Ahmed 2019a; Ahmed 2019b; Asfaw 2014; Chen 2019; Darrouzet Nardi 2016; Evans 2014; Fernald 2011; Gangopadhyay 2015; Haushofer 2013; Hidrobo 2014; Hjelm 2017; Hoddinott 2013; Jensen 2011; Kandpal 2016; Kurdi 2019; Kusuma 2017b; Kusuma 2017a; Miller 2011; Olney 2016; Osei 2017; Ponce 2017; Schwab 2013). Of the 36 included RCTs, 20 reported that allocation was at the cluster level (communities, parishes, electoral divisions, etc.) and carried out at the beginning of the study, and these were classified at low risk of selection bias (Ahmed 2019a; Ahmed 2019b; Baird 2013; Beegle 2017; Brugh 2018; Chen 2019; Daidone 2014; Fenn 2015; Fernald 2011; Gertler 2000 (PROGRESA); Macours 2012; Maluccio 2005; Marquis 2018; Merttens 2013; Olney 2016; Osei 2017; Pellerano 2014; Schwab 2013; Skoufias 2013; Tonguet Papucci 2015). Three studies did not conceal allocation or report this, but household selection was done after villages had been allocated to each intervention group, and knowledge of allocation could have influenced the household selection process (Evans 2014; Hidrobo 2014; Kurdi 2019). In Gangopadhyay 2015, participants self\u00e2\u0080\u0090selected into the intervention. These four studies were at high risk of selection bias. The remaining 12 studies did not report details on allocation concealment and were at unclear risk of selection bias (Asfaw 2014; Darrouzet Nardi 2016; Haushofer 2013; Hjelm 2017; Hoddinott 2013; Jensen 2011; Kandpal 2016; Kusuma 2017b; Kusuma 2017a; Miller 2011; Ponce 2017; Verbowski 2018). All 23 PCS were at high risk of selection bias (both for random sequence and allocation concealment), according to EPOC's risk of bias tool guidance (EPOC 2017). Baseline similarity in participants characteristics and outcome measures (selection bias) Baseline imbalances in participant characteristics or outcome measures may occur in non\u00e2\u0080\u0090randomised studies as well as in randomised studies in which the allocation procedure was not performed adequately. Participants characteristics In 46 included studies, there were no baseline imbalances reported for participant characteristics or, if there were, these were adjusted for in the analyses, and thus they were at low risk of selection bias (Figure 4). Four studies had significant differences at baseline that were not adjusted for in the analyses; thus they were at high risk of selection bias (Asadullah 2015; Beegle 2017; Kurdi 2019; Merttens 2013). Ten studies were at unclear risk of selection bias: six did not report any or some baseline characteristics (Aguero 2006; Breisinger 2018; Murshed E Jahan 2011; Ponce 2017; Porter 2016; Sturm 2013), one reported baseline characteristics but not whether these were balanced (Gangopadhyay 2015), one reported that characteristics were balanced at household level but not at province level (Jensen 2011), one reported discrepancies and it was unclear whether these were adjusted for in the analysis (Schwab 2013), and one only had baseline data for the group analysed, not for the entire sample (Chen 2019). Outcome measures Thirty\u00e2\u0080\u0090one studies either were balanced at baseline with regards to outcome measures, or adjusted for any imbalance in the analyses, and were at low risk of selection bias (Figure 4). In seven studies there were significant baseline imbalances in relevant outcomes which were not controlled for in the analyses, and these were at high risk of selection bias (Andersen 2015; Asadullah 2015; Beegle 2017; Breisinger 2018; Merttens 2013; Renzaho 2017; Sturm 2013). The remaining 21 studies were classified at unclear risk of selection bias: 15 did not report any or relevant outcomes at baseline (Aguero 2006; Baird 2013; Chen 2019; Darrouzet Nardi 2016; Evans 2014; Gertler 2000 (PROGRESA); Hjelm 2017; Huerta 2006 (PROGRESA); Kandpal 2016; Kurdi 2019; Kusuma 2017b; Kusuma 2017a; Murshed E Jahan 2011; Porter 2016; Verbowski 2018); in three, the baseline data collection occurred after the intervention started, so true baseline data were not available (Hoddinott 2013; Lopez Arana 2016; Schwab 2013), in two studies it was unclear if reported imbalances were adjusted for (Doocy 2017; Osei 2017), and in one, although the outcomes were balanced at household level, there were imbalances at province level (Jensen 2011). Blinding Blinding participants and personnel to intervention allocation during the study helps prevent systematic differences in how participants are treated or behave during the trial due to knowledge of treatment allocation (performance bias). In the types of studies included in this review, blinding of participants and personnel was often not feasible; however, it is also unlikely that it would have influenced the behaviour of participants or personnel beyond that expected as part of the intervention, and thus less likely to be susceptible to performance bias. Thus, in all but one study included in this review, the risk of performance bias was low. One study was at high risk of performance bias as blinding was not possible and the delivery of the intervention, a nutrition subsidy to schools, was dependent on the school principal (Chen 2019). Blinding of outcome assessors helps prevent systematic differences in how outcomes are assessed in either intervention groups due to knowledge of treatment allocation (detection bias). Fifteen studies were at low risk of detection bias; in 14 of these studies, blinding was not done; however, the outcomes measured and reported were objective and thus unlikely to have been influenced by knowledge of treatment allocation (Aguero 2006; Ahmed 2019a; Ahmed 2019b; Andersen 2015; Fernald 2011; Kusuma 2017b; Kusuma 2017a; Leroy 2008 (PROGRESA); Lopez Arana 2016; Marquis 2018; Osei 2017; Porter 2016; Renzaho 2017; Skoufias 2013). The other study was based on scanner sales data from supermarkets, which is not susceptible to detection bias due to lack of blinding (Sturm 2013). The remaining 44 studies were at high risk of detection bias either because there was no blinding or they included self\u00e2\u0080\u0090reported or subjective outcomes that were susceptible to be influenced by knowledge of treatment allocation. Protection against contamination (performance bias) If the control group is exposed to the intervention intended for the intervention group, contamination occurs, introducing performance bias. Thirty\u00e2\u0080\u0090seven studies were at low risk of bias in this domain either because they reported evidence of no contamination, or because the intervention and control groups were allocated at the community/village/district level (i.e. in distinct geographical areas), which precludes contamination. Eight studies were at high risk of bias as they reported evidence of control group exposure to the intervention (Asfaw 2014; Doocy 2017; Ferre 2014; Huerta 2006 (PROGRESA); Jodlowski 2016; Kandpal 2016; Katz 2001; Kurdi 2019). The remaining 14 studies were at unclear risk (Aguero 2006; Andersen 2015; Asadullah 2015; Brunie 2014; Daidone 2014; Gertler 2000 (PROGRESA); Kangmennaang 2017; Lopez Arana 2016; Maluccio 2005; Murshed E Jahan 2011;Osei 2017; Ponce 2017; Porter 2016; Skoufias 2013). In these studies, the location or the distance between intervention and control communities was unclear, or the control and intervention households were in same community and there was potential for control households to have benefited from the intervention through interaction with intervention households (e.g. sharing), or communities were geographically near/adjacent. Incomplete outcome data Twenty\u00e2\u0080\u0090five studies were at low risk of bias because they had low attrition (i.e. 10% or less) or because attrition between the groups was non\u00e2\u0080\u0090differential or unrelated to the outcome. Seventeen studies were at high risk of attrition bias, because of high levels of attrition or they reported differential attrition between intervention groups or characteristics of those lost to follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up were different from those remaining in the study, or a combination of these (Andaleeb 2016; Asadullah 2015; Asfaw 2014; Chen 2019; Doocy 2017; Huerta 2006 (PROGRESA); Kandpal 2016; Kangmennaang 2017; Katz 2001; Kurdi Leroy 2008 (PROGRESA); Lopez Arana 2016; Merttens 2013; Ponce 2017; Schwab 2013; Skoufias 2013; Weinhardt 2017). Skoufias 2013 reported only a 5% difference in attrition between groups but lost one entire cluster and participants were excluded from the analysis were different than those included in the analysis, thus was classified at high risk. Seventeen studies were classified at unclear risk of attrition bias, as they either did not report attrition at all or did not report enough information to make this judgement (Aguero 2006; Alaofe 2016; Alaofe 2019; Beegle 2017; Brunie 2014; Chakrabarti 2018; Darrouzet Nardi 2016; Fernald 2011; Ferre 2014; Gertler 2000 (PROGRESA); Hjelm 2017; Kennedy 1989; Olney 2016; Osei 2017; Porter 2016; Sturm 2013; Verbowski 2018). Sturm 2013 analysed supermarket sales scanner data and did not report if any of these data were excluded or missing. Selective reporting Selective outcome reporting occurs when authors do not report on all outcomes prespecified and assessed in the study. Six studies were at low risk of bias, as they reported the same outcomes that were prespecified in the trial registry (Baird 2013; Fenn 2015; Haushofer 2013; Olney 2016; Verbowski 2018; Weinhardt 2017). One study was at high risk of bias because some of the morbidity outcomes (oedema and measles) reported in protocol were not reported in the published paper (Tonguet Papucci 2015). The remaining 52 studies were at unclear risk of bias as there were no protocols available. Other potential sources of bias Under other potential sources of bias we considered whether the study could have been influenced by 1. misclassification bias of the exposure (i.e. when exposure to the intervention was self\u00e2\u0080\u0090reported); 2. measurement bias (i.e. whether outcomes were measured appropriately; 3. incorrect analysis, in the case of cRCTs (i.e. whether study data were adjusted for clustering. Such analyses do not lead to biased estimates of effect but in the meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis such studies receive undue weight leading to overprecision of the effect estimate); and 4. recruitment bias, in the case of cRCTs (i.e. whether recruitment of participants was done before allocation of clusters to intervention groups). Twenty\u00e2\u0080\u0090two studies were at low risk as no other potential sources of bias were identified. Six studies were at high risk of bias as at least one other potential source of bias was identified (Alaofe 2019; Asfaw 2014; Gertler 2000 (PROGRESA); Huerta 2006 (PROGRESA); Osei 2017; Schwab 2013). Asfaw 2014 was at high risk for misclassification bias as receipt of the intervention was based on self\u00e2\u0080\u0090report. Three were at high risk of recruitment bias as clusters were assigned before households were recruited (Asfaw 2014; Gertler 2000 (PROGRESA); Osei 2017). Two studies were at high risk of measurement bias: in Huerta 2006 (PROGRESA) preliminary analyses showed evidence of reporting error regarding health outcomes, and in Alaofe 2019 dietary data were collected with only one 24\u00e2\u0080\u0090hour recall. Schwab 2013 was at high risk of other bias due to the different timing of implementation of interventions in each group. The remaining 31 studies were at unclear risk of other bias; in these studies there was at least one of the other potential sources of bias for which there was insufficient information to make a judgement. Effects of interventions See: Table 1; Table 2; Table 3; Table 4; Table 5; Table 6 We present the effects of interventions on primary and secondary outcomes separately for each category of intervention as outlined below (see Table 8 for definitions of intervention categories and types). Interventions that improved buying power: Unconditional cash transfers Conditional cash transfers Income generation interventions Interventions that addressed food prices: Food prices \u00e2\u0080\u0093 food vouchers Food prices \u00e2\u0080\u0093 food and nutrition subsidies Interventions that addressed the social environment Social support interventions (community grants/savings schemes) We found no studies addressing the intervention category of infrastructure changes, which we had intended to include in the review. The 'Summary of findings' tables provide an overview of effects on all primary outcomes and key secondary outcomes, for each comparison. Comparison 1: unconditional cash transfers Twenty\u00e2\u0080\u0090one included studies assessed UCTs, where a specific amount of money was transferred to poor families monthly or once every two months, with no conditions regarding behaviours expected from the families. Fourteen cRCTs (Ahmed 2019a; Ahmed 2019b; Asfaw 2014; Baird 2013; Brugh 2018; Daidone 2014; Fenn 2015; Fernald 2011; Hjelm 2017; Merttens 2013; Miller 2011; Pellerano 2014; Skoufias 2013; Tonguet Papucci 2015), two RCTs (Gangopadhyay 2015; Haushofer 2013), and three PCS (Aguero 2006; Breisinger 2018; Renzaho 2017) assessed the effects of UCTs versus no intervention. Two cRCTs assessed UCTs versus food transfers (Hoddinott 2013; Schwab 2013). Five cRCTs reported on the proportion of household expenditure on food (Asfaw 2014; Brugh 2018; Hjelm 2017; Merttens 2013; Miller 2011). Five cRCTs (Brugh 2018; Daidone 2014; Hjelm 2017; Miller 2011; Pellerano 2014) and one RCT (Haushofer 2013) reported on various food security measures, and 10 cRCTs reported on various dietary diversity measures (Ahmed 2019a; Ahmed 2019b; Asfaw 2014; Brugh 2018; Daidone 2014; Merttens 2013; Miller 2011; Pellerano 2014; Skoufias 2013; Tonguet Papucci 2015). Eight cRCTs (Asfaw 2014; Daidone 2014; Fernald 2011; Merttens 2013; Pellerano 2014; Tonguet Papucci 2015; Fenn 2015; Ahmed 2019a; Ahmed 2019b), and one PCS (Aguero 2006) reported various anthropometric measures. Two clusters RCT reported and biochemical indicators (Fernald 2011; Fenn 2015), and three cRCTs reported on cognitive function and development outcomes (Baird 2013; Daidone 2014; Fernald 2011). Three cRCTs (Baird 2013; Fernald 2011; Hjelm 2017) and one RCT (Haushofer 2013) reported on measures of mental well\u00e2\u0080\u0090being. Seven cRCTs reported measures of morbidity (Ahmed 2019a; Ahmed 2019b; Daidone 2014; Fenn 2015; Merttens 2013; Pellerano 2014; Tonguet Papucci 2015), and one cRCT reported adverse effects (Pellerano 2014). Hoddinott 2013 and Schwab 2013, the cRCTs where the comparison group was food transfers, reported on measures of dietary diversity, and Schwab 2013 also reported measures of food security. Further details about the studies in this comparison are presented in Table 14. Table 15 presents results of individual trials included and Table 16 presents results of individual PCS included, on all reported outcomes. The Table 1 and the harvest plot in Figure 5 summarise the effects of UCTs on key outcomes. Primary outcomes 1.1 Change in prevalence of undernourishment None of the included studies measured prevalence of undernourishment. 1.2 Proportion of household expenditure on food As household income increases, the share of household expenditure on food should decrease relative to other household expenditure (INDDEX Project 2018). Five cRCTs reported this outcome (Asfaw 2014; Brugh 2018; Hjelm 2017; Merttens 2013; Miller 2011), with evidence being very uncertain about the effects of UCTs on the proportion of household expenditure on food (5 trials, 11,271 households; very low certainty evidence; Table 1). Effects varied across the five studies, with one study showing a clear effect favouring UCTs, two studies showing an unclear effect potentially favouring UCTs, and two studies show a clear effect favouring the control (P = 0.003; Figure 5). Three of these studies could be included in a forest plot but data could not be pooled due to high heterogeneity (I2 = 92%; Analysis 1.1). Miller 2011 and Brugh 2018 were two different studies assessing the Malawi cash transfer scheme and thus are the same in terms of the characteristics of participants and interventions although Miller 2011 was a pilot study. Hjelm 2017 assessed the Zambia cash transfer programme. These programmes differed in the amount provided by the cash transfer (USD 11 every second month which was fixed versus USD 40 monthly which varied depending on household size and the number of school\u00e2\u0080\u0090aged children). As expected, the effect in Miller was worse than in the other studies. Brugh 2018 reported a clear effect favouring UCTs, with a decrease in the proportion of household expenditure on food by 2 percentage points at 1 year (pp \u00e2\u0080\u00932, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00933.96 to \u00e2\u0080\u00930.4; 3290 households). This study was at low overall risk of bias. Asfaw 2014 and Merttens 2013 reported an unclear effect potentially favouring UCTs, showing a decrease in the proportion of monthly amount spent on food: Merttens 2013 by \u00e2\u0080\u00930.4 pp at one year (2435 participants; P > 0.1) and Asfaw 2014 by \u00e2\u0080\u00930.95 pp at two years (1824 participants; P > 0.1). These studies were both at high overall risk of bias. Miller 2011 and Hjelm 2017 reported a clear effect favouring the control. Miller 2011 reported an increase in the proportion of total weekly expenditures on food by 12 pp in the intervention group compared to the control at one year (P < 0.0001, 752 participants); Hjelm 2017 reported an increase in per capita share of food expenditure of 4.2 pp (95% CI 0.67 to 7.72). Miller 2011 is at low overall risk of bias and Hjelm 2017 at unclear overall risk of bias. 1.3 Proportion of households who were food secure Twelve trials reported on different food security and dietary diversity measures. Food security measures reflect the frequency and severity of food insecurity experienced by households within a specific reference period (e.g. past month), with a higher number usually indicating more food insecurity. Dietary diversity refers to the number of food groups or food items consumed, by households or individuals within a specific reference period (e.g. past 24 hours), with a higher number indicating better dietary diversity. In our analysis, we included composite measures for food security and dietary diversity (e.g. reported scores or indices), in preference to single outcome measures; details of their definitions and interpretations are presented in Table 12. 1.3.1 Food security Five cRCTs and one RCT reported this outcome, with evidence showing that UCTs improve food security (6 trials, 10,251 households and 7604 children; high\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence; Table 1). All six studies showed a clear effect favouring UCTs (P < 0.001; Figure 5). Miller 2011 and Brugh 2018 reported an increase in the proportion of people eating more than one meal per day with the UCTs: Miller 2011 reported an increase of 42 pp at one year follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up (P < 0.0001; 752 participants); Brugh 2018 reported an increase of 11 pp at one year (95% CI 5.12 to 16.9; 3290 households). Data from these studies could not be pooled due to high heterogeneity (I2 = 87%; Analysis 1.2). These two studies assessed cash transfers in Malawi and the characteristics of participants and interventions were the same, but Miller 2011 was a smaller pilot study and was at unclear overall risk of bias whereas Brugh 2018 was at low overall risk of bias. Daidone 2014, Haushofer 2013, and Hjelm 2017 reported food security scores; Hjelm 2017 using the FSI and Daidone 2014 and Haushofer 2013 using a food security scale based on the HFIAS, and for both of these the higher the value the more beneficial. A meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis of these three studies showed a slight improvement in scores (SMD 0.18, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.23; 6209 households; I2 = 0%; Analysis 1.3). Pellerano 2014 reported a decrease in severe food deprivation (FSI > 2) at two years in children aged from birth to five years (\u00e2\u0080\u009316.63 pp; P < 0.05; 2220 children) and in children aged six to 17 years (82116.10 pp; P > 0.1; 5384 children) receiving the UCT compared to children in the control group. Brugh 2018, Daidone 2014, and Pellerano 2014 were at low overall risk of bias, whereas Haushofer 2013, Hjelm 2017, and Miller 2011 were at unclear overall risk of bias. One cRCT at higher overall risk of bias compared food transfers with UCTs (Schwab 2013). They reported on the number of months of the previous six months that households had difficulty satisfying their food needs, with an unclear effect potentially favouring UCTs (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00931.06; P > 0.05; 1983 households). 1.3.2 Dietary diversity Ten cRCTs and one PCS reported dietary diversity measures. Randomised controlled trials Evidence showed that UCTs may increase dietary diversity (10 RCTs; 11,145 households and 3578 children; low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence; Table 1). Five cRCTs reported a clear effect favouring UCTs and five cRCTs reported an unclear effect potentially favouring UCTs (P < 0.001; Figure 5). Ahmed 2019a, Ahmed 2019b, Asfaw 2014, Miller 2011, and Tonguet Papucci 2015 reported clear effects favouring UCTs. Miller reported an increase in the food diversity composite score (scale: 1 to 8) of 2.4 points more with UCTs compared to the control group (95% CI 1.22 to 3.58; 752 households). Ahmed 2019a reported an increase in FCS (scale: 0 to 112) with UCTs at two years of 6.84 points (95% CI 4.64 to 9.03; n NR) and Ahmed 2019b of 2.62 points (95% CI 0.58 to 4.66; n NR). Asfaw 2014 reported a mean dietary diversity score (scale 0 to 8) higher by 0.82 at two years (1824 households; P < 0.01). Tonguet Papucci 2015 reported the odds of achieving MDD, which were approximately three\u00e2\u0080\u0090fold higher in the children from the UCT group (OR 2.95, 95% CI 1.86 to 4.68; n = 322; P < 0.001). Of these studies, Ahmed 2019a, Ahmed 2019b, and Miller 2011 were at unclear overall risk of bias; Asfaw 2014 was at high overall risk of bias and Tonguet Papucci 2015 was at low overall risk of bias. Brugh 2018, Daidone 2014, Merttens 2013, Pellerano 2014, and Skoufias 2013 reported unclear effects potentially favouring UCTs. Four of these cRCTs reported an increase in the mean dietary diversity score at household level (scale: 0 to 12) (Brugh 2018: 0.23 points, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.39 to 0.86; 3290 households; Daidone 2014: 1.43 points; 2298 households; P = NR; Merttens 2013: 0.3 points; 2436 households; P = NR; Pellerano 2014: 0.16; 1486 households; P > 0.1). Skoufias 2013 reported an increase of 10.6 percentage points in the proportion of children in the intervention group achieving MDD, which referred to consuming at least three to six food groups, compared to the control group at two years (pp 10.6, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00936.65 to 27.85; 568 children; P > 0.05). Three studies reporting diet diversity scores had sufficient data for a meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis, but results were not pooled due to high heterogeneity (I2 = 83%; Analysis 1.4) (Asfaw 2014; Brugh 2018; Miller 2011). These studies reported slightly different measures of dietary diversity but, in all cases, a higher value indicated higher dietary diversity. Two studies assessed a cash transfer programme in Malawi and Asfaw 2014 assessed the Kenya cash transfer programme. Both studies in Malawi included ultra\u00e2\u0080\u0090poor households, the one in Kenya included households with orphans and vulnerable children, which may be more vulnerable. Asfaw 2014 was also at high overall risk of bias whereas the others were at unclear and low overall risk of bias. Two studies reporting the proportion of children with MDD could not be pooled due to high heterogeneity (I2 = 94%, Analysis 1.5) (Skoufias 2013; Tonguet Papucci 2015). The interventions in these two studies differed somewhat; Skoufias 2013, which was at high overall risk of bias, made a payment of approximately USD 14 every two months and accompanied by health education sessions that were not compulsory. Tonguet Papucci 2015 assessed seasonal cash payments of USD 17 (from July to November only), with no educational sessions, and payments were made to mothers. The effect was larger for Tonguet Papucci 2015, which was at low overall risk of bias. Two cRCTs compared UCTs with food transfers (Hoddinott 2013; Schwab 2013). Both reported a clear effect on the FCS favouring UCTs (Hoddinott 2013: MD 4.65, 95% CI 2.41 to 6.87, n = NR; Schwab 2013: MD 4.52, 95% CI 6.85 to 2.19; 1581 households). Hoddinott 2013 was at unclear overall risk of bias and Schwab 2013 was at high overall risk of bias. Prospective controlled studies One PCS reported an unclear effect on the HDDS potentially favouring UCTs (0.16, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.07 to 0.39; 6003 households) (Table 15) (Breisinger 2018). This study was at high overall risk of bias. Secondary outcomes 1.4 Change in adequacy of dietary intake Three cRCTs reported change in adequacy of dietary intake (Ahmed 2019a; Ahmed 2019b; Brugh 2018). One study reported a clear effect favouring UCTs and two studies reported an unclear effect potentially favouring UCTs (P = 0.047) (Table 15). Brugh 2018 reported a clear effect favouring the intervention on the proportion of households who were food energy deficient (i.e. where the total household caloric availability was lower than the total household caloric requirement) (pp \u00e2\u0080\u009310, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u009317.8 to \u00e2\u0080\u00932.16; 3290 households). This study was at low overall risk of bias. Ahmed 2019a and Ahmed 2019b reported an unclear effect potentially favouring UCTs. A meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis of these two studies showed that UCTs may make no difference to the proportion of households with food poverty, defined as per capita daily caloric intake below 2122 calories (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00934.64, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00939.34 to 0.06, n = NR). These studies were at low overall risk of bias. 1.5 Change in anthropometric indicators Ten cRCTs (Ahmed 2019a; Ahmed 2019b; Asfaw 2014; Daidone 2014; Fenn 2015; Fernald 2011; Merttens 2013; Pellerano 2014; Skoufias 2013; Tonguet Papucci 2015) and two PCS (Aguero 2006; Renzaho 2017) reported various anthropometric measures. 1.5.1 Stunting: height\u00e2\u0080\u0090for\u00e2\u0080\u0090age z\u00e2\u0080\u0090scores < \u00e2\u0080\u00932SD; chronic undernutrition) Randomised controlled trials Four cRCTs reported on the proportion of children who were stunted (Asfaw 2014; Fenn 2015; Merttens 2013; Tonguet Papucci 2015), with evidence showing that UCTs may reduce stunting (4 trials, 4713 children; low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence; Table 1). One study showed a clear effect favouring UCTs, two studies showed an unclear effect favouring UCTs, and one study showed an unclear effect favouring control (P = 0.047; Figure 5). A meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis of two of these studies showed a reduction in stunting with UCTs (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.84; 2914 children; I2 = 0%; Analysis 1.7) (Fenn 2015; Tonguet Papucci 2015). Fenn 2015 reported a clear effect favouring UCTs, with a reduction in the odds of stunting of 46% at 12 months (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.81; 1664 children). There was a similar effect for the proportion of children who were severely stunted (HAZ < \u00e2\u0080\u00933SD) (Table 15). This study was at low overall risk of bias. Tonguet Papucci 2015 and Asfaw 2014 reported unclear effects potentially favouring UCTs. Tonguet Papucci 2015 reported a reduced likelihood of stunting in the intervention group compared to the control group at 24 months by 27% (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.14; n = 1250; P = 0.17), but the effect ranged from a beneficial effect on the outcome to worsening the outcome. In Asfaw 2014, the intervention reduced the proportion of stunted children by 4.63 pp (P > 0.1). Tonguet Papucci 2015 was at low overall risk of bias whereas Asfaw 2014 was at high overall risk of bias. Merttens 2013 reported an increase in the proportion of stunted children (pp 7.0; 1062 children; P > 0.1) and severely stunted children (pp 1.9; 1062 children; P > 0.1) among those in the UCT group compared to those in the control group. This study was at high overall risk of bias. In addition to the proportion of stunting, six trials reported the effects on mean HAZ (Ahmed 2019a; Ahmed 2019b; Asfaw 2014; Daidone 2014; Fenn 2015; Fernald 2011); and one on mean z\u00e2\u0080\u0090score per month (Tonguet Papucci 2015). A meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis showed an unclear effect of UCTs on HAZ (MD 0.07, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.04 to 0.18; I2 = 56%; Analysis 1.8). A sensitivity analysis performed using only studies at overall low risk of bias showed a clear effect favouring UCTs (MD 0.16, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.29; Appendix 4) (Daidone 2014; Fenn 2015). Prospective controlled studies One PCS reported a clear effect favouring UCTs on stunting at five years (pp \u00e2\u0080\u00935.16, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00939.55 to \u00e2\u0080\u00930.77; 1491 children; Table 15; Figure 5) (Renzaho 2017). Renzaho 2017 and Aguero 2006 also reported on the effect of UCTs on mean HAZ (data not pooled as SE was not available for either study). Renzaho 2017 reported a clear effect favouring UCTs at five years (pp 18, 95% CI 9 to 27; 1491 children). Aguero 2006 reported that after 72 months, the mean z\u00e2\u0080\u0090score was better in children receiving the intervention (\u00e2\u0080\u00930.84) than in those who only received the intervention after they were aged three years (\u00e2\u0080\u00930.91) (566 children) or those who were rejected or were not yet receiving the intervention (\u00e2\u0080\u00931.08) (399 children). Both studies are at high overall risk of bias. Aguero 2006 also reported the effects of the intervention on HAZ for children receiving the child care grant for different periods of the critical nutritional window aged between 0 and 36 months. They found that for children receiving the intervention for less than 20% of this period there was no effect on HAZ. Compared to receiving a 'small dose', they found a significant impact on HAZ for children receiving the intervention during 45% to 80% of the nutrition window (mean change in HAZ 0.15 at 45%, and 0.25 at 80% of nutritional window; data derived from graphs). 1.5.2 Wasting: weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090for\u00e2\u0080\u0090height z\u00e2\u0080\u0090score < \u00e2\u0080\u00932SD (acute undernutrition) Randomised controlled trials Four cRCTs reported\u00c2\u00a0effects of UCTs on wasting (Asfaw 2014; Fenn 2015; Merttens 2013; Tonguet Papucci 2015). Evidence showed that there was uncertainty about whether UCTs reduce wasting (4 trials, 6396 children; very low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence; Table 1). One study showed an unclear effect potentially favouring UCTs and three studies showed an unclear effect potentially favouring the control (P = 0.016; Figure 5). Tonguet Papucci 2015 reported an unclear effect potentially favouring the intervention, observing a 2% decrease in the risk of wasting at two years (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0.92, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.32; 1250 children; P = 0.66). However, this effect ranged from a 36% reduction to a 32% increase in risk. Asfaw 2014, Merttens 2013, and Fenn 2015 reported an unclear effect potentially favouring the control as they observed an increase in the proportion of wasting among children receiving UCTs, but reported a CI that crossed the null. In Fenn 2015, the odds of wasting was 10% higher among children receiving the intervention at one year (OR 1.10, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.71; 1664 children). At two years, the proportion of wasted children was 5.95 pp higher among those in the UCT group in Asfaw 2014 (989 children; P > 0.1) and 4.7 pp in Merttens 2013 (1062 children; P > 0.1). In Merttens 2013, the proportion of children younger than five years who were severely wasted also increased by 3.9 pp (P > 0.1). Both studies are at high overall risk of bias. In addition to the effects on stunting, five cRCTs reported on the effect of UCTs on mean WHZ (Ahmed 2019a; Ahmed 2019b; Asfaw 2014; Daidone 2014; Fenn 2015) and one on mean WHZ/month (Tonguet Papucci 2015). A meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis of data from these studies showed that UCTs made no difference on WHZ (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00930.02, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.10 to 0.06; I2 = 36%; Analysis 1.9). Two of these studies were at unclear overall risk of bias and one at high overall risk of bias. A sensitivity analysis of studies at low overall risk of bias studies changed the direction of effect to unclearly favour UCTs (MD 0.02, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.18 to 0.21; Appendix 4) (Daidone 2014; Fenn 2015). Prospective controlled studies One PCS reported on stunting, with effects clearly favouring UCTs (pp \u00e2\u0080\u00932.84, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00935.58 to \u00e2\u0080\u00930.1; 1491 children) (Figure 5) (Renzaho 2017). This study was at high overall risk of bias. This study also reported on effect of UCTs on mean WHZ, also reporting a clear effect favouring UCTs (MD 0.19, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.03; 1491 children) (Table 16). 1.5.3 Underweight 1.5.3.1 Weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090for\u00e2\u0080\u0090age z\u00e2\u0080\u0090scores < \u00e2\u0080\u00932SD Three cRCTs reported unclear effects of UCTs on the proportion of underweight children (Asfaw 2014; Merttens 2013; Pellerano 2014). Two trials reported unclear effects potentially favouring UCTs and one trial reported unclear effects potentially favouring the control (P = 0.047) (Table 15; Figure 5). The two studies favouring the intervention reported an unclear effect potentially favouring UCTs on underweight (Asfaw 2014; Pellerano 2014). Pellerano 2014 reported a reduction in proportion of children aged from birth to 36 months who were underweight at two years by 3.64 pp when they were aged 12 months (P > 0.05), Asfaw 2014 reported a reduction of 0.62 pp in the proportion of children aged under five years who were underweight (pp \u00e2\u0080\u00930.62; 1491 children; P > 0.1). Merttens 2013 reported an unclear effect favouring the control, as they reported an increase in the proportion of children who were underweight or severely underweight in the UCT group (3.9 pp with UCT versus 3.2 pp with control; 1062 children; P > 0.1). In addition to the effects of UCTs on underweight, two trials also reported on the effects of UCTs on mean WAZ (Asfaw 2014; Daidone 2014). A meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis of these two studies showed that UCTs may have no effect on underweight (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00930.04, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.43, 0.35; 7577 children: I2 = 74%; Analysis 1.10). Daidone 2014 was at low overall risk of bias, whereas Asfaw 2014 was at high overall risk of bias. Daidone 2014 assessed a child grant programme and Asfaw 2014 assessed a cash transfer programme for households with orphans and vulnerable children, where in some districts some conditions, such as school attendance, and penalties were imposed even though the programme was unconditional. 1.5.3.2 Body mass index One cRCT reported unclear effects potentially favouring the control on BMI of mothers at six months (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00930.1, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.36 to 0.16; 1208 mothers; Table 15) (Fenn 2015). 1.5.3.3 Mid\u00e2\u0080\u0090upper arm circumference One cRCT reported unclear effects potentially favouring UCTs on MUAC measures for mothers and children (MD 0.09, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.13 to 0.3; 1208 mothers; MD 0.06, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.02 to 0.15; 1683 children; Table 15) (Fenn 2015). 1.6 Change in biochemical indicators 1.6.1 Haemoglobin concentration Two cRCTs reported on the effects of UCTs on haemoglobin concentration (Fenn 2015; Fernald 2011). A meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis of these two studies showed an unclear effect of UCTs on haemoglobin in children (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00930.06, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.21 to 0.09; 2605 children; Analysis 1.11). Fenn 2015 also reported on the effects in mothers, finding a clear effect favouring the control on haemoglobin in mothers receiving UCTs (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00930.42, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.63 to \u00e2\u0080\u00930.20; 1208 mothers). Both studies were at low overall risk of bias. 1.7 Cognitive function and development Three cRCTs reported different measures of cognitive function and development (Baird 2013; Daidone 2014; Fernald 2011). Evidence showed that UCTs make little or no difference on cognitive function and development (3 cRCTs; 10,813 children; high\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence; Table 1). All three trials reported an unclear effect favouring the intervention (P = 0.016; Figure 5). Baird 2013 reported an increase in the cognitive test score based on a version of Raven's Colored Progressive matrices at two years (MD 0.14 SDs, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.26; 2057 children) and Daidone 2014 reported an increase in the Early Childhood Development score among children receiving UCTs at two years (MD 0.31; 5670 children; P > 0.1) (Table 15). Fernald 2011 reported on scores after two years for language development in young children receiving UCTs, using two different measures: scores for early language skills of children aged 12 to 35 months using the Inventario do Desenvolvemento de Habilidades Comunicativas (IDHC)\u00e2\u0080\u0090B tool (MD 2.43, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00931.01 to 5.86; 1192 children; P > 0.1), and scores for the receptive vocabulary test (Test de Vocabulario en Imagenes Peabody (TVIP)) in children older than 36 months (MD 0.01, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.08 to 0.10; 1894 children; P > 0.1). However, for both of these, the effect ranged from a decrease to an increase in scores. All cognitive measures reported in the included studies are summarised in Table 13. 1.8 Change in proportion of anxiety or depression (mental health indicators) Three cRCTs (Baird 2013; Fernald 2011; Hjelm 2017) and one RCT (Haushofer 2013) reported different measures of mental health. 1.8.1 Depression Fernald 2011, Haushofer 2013, and Hjelm 2017 reported effects of UCTs on depressive symptoms scores using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES\u00e2\u0080\u0090D) (higher scores indicate worse symptoms). The meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis indicated that UCTs do not make a difference in depression scores at two years (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00930.41, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00931.31 to 0.49; 5787 participants; I2 = 36%; Analysis 1.12). Fernald 2011 assessed the effect of the intervention on men and women, Haushofer 2013 on mothers, and Hjelm 2017 on adolescents. Fernald 2011 and Haushofer 2013 were at low overall risk of bias and Hjelm 2017 was at unclear overall risk of bias. 1.8.2 Perceived stress Two cRCTs (Fernald 2011; Hjelm 2017) and one RCT (Haushofer 2013) reported on the effects of UCTs on perceived stress using Cohen's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) (lower values correspond to less stress). A meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis of Haushofer 2013 and Hjelm 2017 indicated that UCTs may reduce perceived stress (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00930.15, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.26 to \u00e2\u0080\u00930.03; n = 3570; I2 = 0%; Analysis 1.13). Fernald 2011 reported an increase in the perceived stress z\u00e2\u0080\u0090score of mothers in the intervention group at two years, both for those in the bottom quartile of baseline expenditure (MD 0.18, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.02 to 0.37; n = 1430; P < 0.1) and for those in the top three quartiles of baseline expenditure at two years (MD 0.05, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.11 to 0.20; P > 0.1). 1.8.3 Psychological distress One cRCT reported on psychological distress, a binary measure of psychological distress, anxiety and depression; social dysfunction; and loss of confidence based on the 12\u00e2\u0080\u0090item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ\u00e2\u0080\u009012) (Baird 2013). Among girls who were attending school and exposed to a UCT compared to girls in the control group, the proportion of psychological distress was smaller by 14.3 pp at one year (95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u009321.0 to \u00e2\u0080\u00937.6), and by 3.8 pp at two years (95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u009313.14 to 5.8; n = 2089; P > 0.1), but the effect at two years was imprecise. 1.9 Morbidity Seven cRCTs reported on different morbidity measures (Ahmed 2019a; Ahmed 2019b; Daidone 2014; Fenn 2015; Merttens 2013; Pellerano 2014; Tonguet Papucci 2015). 1.9.1 Respiratory infections Four cRCTs reported on the effects of UCTs on respiratory infections (Asfaw 2014; Daidone 2014; Fenn 2015; Tonguet Papucci 2015). Two trials reported a clear effect favouring the intervention and two trials reported an unclear effect potentially favouring the intervention (P = 0.023; Table 15). Data could not be pooled. Asfaw 2014 and Tonguet Papucci 2015 reported clear effects favouring UCTs. Tonguet Papucci 2015 reported a 21% reduced incidence of acute respiratory tract infection episodes among children aged from birth to 15 months in the previous seven days, as refereed by mothers (IRR 0.79, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.81; 1250 children; P < 0.001). Asfaw 2014 reported a reduced risk of respiratory infections of 44% among children aged from birth to seven years (957 children; P < 0.05). Asfaw 2014 was at high overall risk of bias whereas Tonguet Papucci 2015 was at low overall risk of bias. Daidone 2014 and Fenn 2015 reported unclear effects potentially favouring UCTs. Daidone 2014 reported that the proportion of children aged from birth to 60 months with acute respiratory tract infection in a two\u00e2\u0080\u0090week reference period was lower by 3.6 pp in the intervention group compared to the control group (effect estimate \u00e2\u0080\u00930.036, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.061 to \u00e2\u0080\u00930.011; P > 0.05). In Fenn 2015, the odds of respiratory infections was 27% lower among children in the UCT group (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.03; 1683 children). Both studies were at low overall risk of bias. 1.9.2 Diarrhoeal disease Five cRCTs reported on the effects of UCTs on diarrhoeal disease (Ahmed 2019a; Ahmed 2019b; Daidone 2014; Fenn 2015; Tonguet Papucci 2015). One study reported a clear effect favouring UCTs, two studies reported an unclear effect potentially favouring UCTs, one study reported an unclear effect potentially favouring the control, and one study reported no effect (P = 0.047) (Table 15). Daidone 2014 reported clear effects favouring UCTs. Among children aged from birth to 60 months in the UCT group, the proportion with diarrhoea in the previous two weeks reduced by 4.9 pp at one year (pp \u00e2\u0080\u00934.9, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00938.9 to \u00e2\u0080\u00930.9; 7232 children; P < 0.05). Ahmed 2019a and Ahmed 2019b reported unclear effects potentially favouring UCTs. In Ahmed 2019a, there was a reduction in the proportion of children with diarrhoea of 0.3 pp (95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.04 to 0.04, n = NR), and in Ahmed 2019b of 0.9 pp (95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.05 to 0.03, n = NR). All studies were at low overall risk of bias. Tonguet Papucci 2015 reported no difference between the groups in the incidence of diarrhoeal episodes in the previous seven days, as reported by the mother, after one year of the intervention (IRR 1.00, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.03; 1250 children; P = 0.89). This study was at low overall risk of bias. 1.9.3 Any illness Two cRCTs reported on the effects of UCTs on the proportion of children or people who were ill (Merttens 2013; Pellerano 2014), one reporting a clear effect favouring UCTs and the other unclear effects favouring the control (P = 0.125) (Table 15). Pellerano 2014 reported a reduction in the proportion of children who were ill in the previous month in the intervention compared to the control group by 15 pp at one year (from 39% to 31%) (pp \u00e2\u0080\u009315,38; 1996 children; P < 0.1). In Merttens 2013, there was no difference between the intervention and control groups in the proportion of people who reported being ill or injured in the previous three months, after one year of the intervention (pp 1.0; 14,342 participants; P > 0.1). In this study, these proportions reduced significantly in both intervention and control groups, and injuries were also included as an 'illness'. Pellerano 2014 was at low overall risk of bias whereas Merttens 2013 was at high overall risk of bias due to high risk of selection and attrition bias. 1.10 Adverse outcomes (proportion of participants overweight or obese) Pellerano 2014, a cRCT, reported unclear effects potentially favouring UCTs on the proportion of infants who were overweight when they were aged six and 12 months, at two years of the intervention (6 months old: pp \u00e2\u0080\u00935.08; 474 children; P > 0.05; 12 months old: pp \u00e2\u0080\u00936.46; 293 children; P > 0.05) (Table 15). Comparison 2: conditional cash transfers Fourteen included studies assessed CCTs, where a specified amount of money was transferred to poor families regularly as long as they meet specific conditions. Nine were cRCTs (Baird 2013; Evans 2014; Gertler 2000 (PROGRESA); Hidrobo 2014; Kandpal 2016; Kurdi 2019; Kusuma 2017a; Macours 2012; Maluccio 2005) and five were PCS (Andersen 2015; Ferre 2014; Huerta 2006 (PROGRESA); Leroy 2008 (PROGRESA); Lopez Arana 2016). All studies compared CCTs with no intervention. However, requirements and other intervention components differed across studies. Requirements (or conditions) included regular check\u00e2\u0080\u0090ups for children, school enrolment and regular attendance, vaccination, micronutrient supplementation for children or for pregnant women, and attending nutrition education sessions. Two cRCTs (Macours 2012; Maluccio 2005) and one PCS (Ferre 2014) reported the proportion of household expenditure on food. Two cRCTs (Hidrobo 2014; Kurdi 2019) and one PCS (Ferre 2014) reported on dietary diversity measures. Seven cRCTs (Evans 2014; Gertler 2000 (PROGRESA); Kandpal 2016; Kusuma 2017a; Kurdi 2019; Macours 2012; Maluccio 2005; ) and four PCS (Andersen 2015Leroy 2008 (PROGRESA); Lopez Arana 2016; Ferre 2014) reported on various anthropometric measures. Two cRCTs (Baird 2013; Macours 2012) and one PCS (Andersen 2015) reported on cognitive function and development measures. One cRCT (Baird 2013) reported on psychological distress. Four cRCTs reported measures of morbidity (Evans 2014; Gertler 2000 (PROGRESA); Kandpal 2016; Macours 2012). Two PCS reported adverse measures of overweight (Andersen 2015; Lopez Arana 2016). Further details about the studies in this comparison are presented in Table 17. Table 18 presents the results of cRCTs and Table 19 of PCS. Table 2 and harvest plot in Figure 6 summarise the results of CCTs on key outcomes. Primary outcomes 2.1 Change in the prevalence of undernourishment None of the included studies measured prevalence of undernourishment. 2.2 Proportion of household expenditure on food Two cRCTs (Macours 2012; Maluccio 2005) and one PCS (Ferre 2014) reported proportion of household expenditure on food. Randomised controlled trials Evidence from two cRCTs indicated that CCTs result in little to no difference in the proportion of household expenditure on food (4760 households, 2 RCTs; high\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence; Table 2). One study reported a clear effect favouring the control and one study reported an unclear effect potentially favouring the control (P = 0.125) (Figure 6). Both studies were at low overall risk of bias. Maluccio 2005 reported clear effects favouring the control, with an increase in the proportion of household expenditure of 3.9 pp at one year (1490 households; P < 0.01) and of 4.1 pp at two years (1434 households; P < 0.01) (Table 18). Macours 2012 reported an unclear effect potentially favouring the control because among those in the intervention group the proportion of household expenditure increased very slightly by 0.01 SDs (95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.01 to 0.02; 3326 households). Prospective controlled studies Ferre 2014 reported on this outcome but did not report an effect estimate (Table 19). 2.3 Proportion of households who were food secure 2.3.1 Food security None of the studies in this comparison reported food security. 2.3.2 Dietary diversity Randomised controlled trials Evidence from two cRCTs indicated that CCTs probably slightly increase dietary diversity (3937 households; 2 cRCTs; moderate\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence; Table 2; Figure 6) (Hidrobo 2014; Kurdi 2019). A meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis of these two studies, which reported FCS (scale: 0 to 112, higher score indicating better dietary diversity) showed a clear effect favouring CCTs (MD 0.45, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.65; 3937 households; I2 = 0%). Both trials were at high overall risk of bias. Prospective controlled trials Ferre 2014 reported an unclear effect potentially favouring CCT on the proportion of children with MDD (i.e. proportion of children aged six months and above fed from at least four food groups) (Figure 6). The proportion of children with MDD increased by 3.1 pp with CCTs compared to the control group at 13 months (MD 0.03, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.07 to 0.13, n = 1318) (Table 19). Secondary outcomes 2.4 Change in adequacy of dietary intake No included study reported the adequacy of dietary intake. Some studies reported caloric availability and intake; we have not reported these data as they do not relate to measures of adequacy. 2.5 Change in anthropometric indicators Seven cRCTs (Evans 2014; Gertler 2000 (PROGRESA); Kandpal 2016; Kusuma 2017a; Kurdi 2019; Macours 2012; Maluccio 2005) and four PCS (Andersen 2015; Ferre 2014; Leroy 2008 (PROGRESA); Lopez Arana 2016) reported on various anthropometric measures. 2.5.1 Stunting: height\u00e2\u0080\u0090for\u00e2\u0080\u0090age z\u00e2\u0080\u0090scores < \u00e2\u0080\u00932SD (chronic undernutrition) Cluster randomised controlled trials Evidence from four cRCTs (Gertler 2000 (PROGRESA); Kandpal 2016; Kusuma 2017a; Maluccio 2005) showed that CCTs may make little or no difference to the proportion of stunted children (4 RCTs, 3529 children; low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence; Table 2). Three studies showed an unclear effect favouring CCTs and one study showed an unclear effect potentially favouring the control (P = 0.016) (Figure 6). Gertler 2000 (PROGRESA), Kandpal 2016, and Maluccio 2005 reported an unclear effect potentially favouring CCTs. The proportion of stunted children was reduced among those receiving CCTs in these three studies; however, all the 95% CI crossed the null effect (Table 18). In Maluccio 2005, the proportion reduced by 5.3 pp at two years (95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u009311.38 to 0.78; 722 children aged under 5 years); in Gertler 2000 (PROGRESA), the odds of children being stunted was lower by 8.6% at 1.6 years (OR 0.91; 1062 children; P = 0.495); and in Kandpal 2016 the proportion of stunted children was lower by 3.77 pp at three years (95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u009313.83 to 6.29; 351 children younger than 36 months; P > 0.1). Kandpal 2016 also reported that, in the CCT group, the proportion of children who were severely stunted was reduced by 10.19 pp compared to the control group at three years (95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u009318.77 to \u00e2\u0080\u00931.61; 351 children). Kusuma 2017a reported an unclear effect potentially favouring the control. Among children aged 24 to 36 months in the CCT group, the proportion of stunting increased by 3.5 pp (95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00935.5 to 12.5; 1394 children) (Table 18). This study reported a similar effect on the proportion of children who were severely stunted (HAZ < \u00e2\u0080\u00933SD). A meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis of three of these studies showed an unclear effect favouring CCTs (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00932.51, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00937.78 to 2.75; 2467 children; I2 = 22%; Analysis 2.2) (Kandpal 2016; Kusuma 2017a; Maluccio 2005). The two studies that reported on the effects of CCTs on severe stunting could not be pooled due to high heterogeneity (I2 = 78%; Analysis 2.3) (Kandpal 2016; Kusuma 2017a). The cash transfer programmes evaluated in these studies are similar in the cash transfer amount and programme conditions; however, Kusuma 2017a included children aged 24 to 36 months whereas Kandpal 2016 included children under 36 months. They also differed in their overall risk of bias, with Kandpal 2016 at high and Kusuma 2017a at unclear risk. In addition to reporting the effects of CCTs on stunting, five cRCTs reported on mean HAZ (Evans 2014; Kandpal 2016; Kurdi 2019; Macours 2012; Maluccio 2005). A meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis of these studies indicated that CCTs improve mean HAZ (MD 0.09, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.15; 5619 children; I2 = 0%; Analysis 2.4). The follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up period ranged from nine months to three years. Three of the studies in this comparison were at high overall risk of bias (Evans 2014; Kandpal 2016; Kurdi 2019), and the others at low overall risk of bias. A sensitivity analysis of the studies at overall low risk of bias did not affect the results (Appendix 4) (Macours 2012; Maluccio 2005). Prospective controlled studies Three PCS reported on stunting (Lopez Arana 2016, Andersen 2015; Ferre 2014). Two reported unclear effects potentially favouring CCTs and one reported unclear effects potentially favouring the control (P = 0.047; Figure 6; Table 19). All studies were at high overall risk of bias. Lopez Arana 2016 and Andersen 2015 reported unclear effects potentially favouring CCTs. Lopez Arana 2016 reported a reduction in stunting among 2874 children in the intervention group at four years but the CIs overlapped with the null effect (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.05; P > 0.05). In Andersen 2015, there was a smaller proportion of stunted children in the intervention group, both among those receiving the intervention for less than two years (treatment effect: \u00e2\u0080\u00937.98, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u009322.3 to 6.34; 188 children; P = 0.27) as well as those receiving the intervention for longer than two years (treatment effect \u00e2\u0080\u009318.3, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u009338.3 to 1.59; 169 children; P = 0.07). Both of these studies were at high overall risk of bias. Ferre 2014 reported unclear effects potentially favouring the control, with a higher proportion of stunted children in the CCT group by 3.4 pp at approximately one year (95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00936.4 to 13.2). A meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis of two of these studies indicated an unclear effect potentially favouring CCTs (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00935.63, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u009326.59 to 15.34; 1749 children; I2 = 73%; Analysis 2.5) (Andersen 2015; Ferre 2014). In addition to reporting the effects of CCTs on stunting, three PCS, all at high overall risk of bias, reported on mean HAZ (Andersen 2015; Leroy 2008 (PROGRESA); Lopez Arana 2016). The pooled analysis indicated that CCTs may or may not increase HAZ, as the effect could range from a small reduction to a significant increase in HAZ (MD 0.03, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.06 to 0.12; 3475 children, I2 = 0%; Analysis 2.6). 2.5.2. Wasting: weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090for\u00e2\u0080\u0090height z\u00e2\u0080\u0090scores < \u00e2\u0080\u00932SD (acute undernutrition) Four cRCTs (Evans 2014; Kurdi 2019; Kusuma 2017a; Maluccio 2005) and three PCS (Ferre 2014; Leroy 2008 (PROGRESA); Lopez Arana 2016) reported measures related to wasting. Cluster randomised controlled trials Evidence from two cRCTs indicated that CCTs may make little or no difference to wasting (2 trials, 2116 children; low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence; Table 2; Figure 6) (Maluccio 2005; Kusuma 2017a). A meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis showed an unclear effect favouring CCTs (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00932.50, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00938.04 to 3.04; I2 = 70%; Analysis 2.7). Two other trials reported on the effects of CCTs on mean WHZ (Evans 2014; Kurdi 2019). A meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis indicated an unclear effect potentially favouring CCTs (MD 0.17, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.11 to 0.44; 1111 children; I2 = 0%; Analysis 2.8). Prospective controlled studies Two PCS reported on the effects of CCTs on wasting (Lopez Arana 2016; Ferre 2014). One study reported clear effects favouring CCTs and one study unclear effects potentially favouring CCTs (P = 0.125) (Figure 6; Table 19). Data could not be pooled. Both studies were at high overall risk of bias. Lopez Arana 2016 reported a clear effect favouring CCTs. In this study the odds of wasting were reduced by 75% among children in the CCT group at four years (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.74; 2874 children). Ferre 2014 reported an unclear effect potentially favouring CCTs. The proportion of wasted children was lower in the CCT group at 13 months, by 3.6 pp for those that were aged 22 to 46 months when enrolled (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00930.04, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.11 to 0.04) and by 13 pp for those aged 10 to 22 months when enrolled (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00930.13, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.26 to 0.01). However, effects ranged from potential benefit to potential harm. In addition, one PCS, at high overall risk of bias, reported an unclear effect on WHZ potentially favouring CCTs (Leroy 2008 (PROGRESA)). The mean WHZ was higher by 0.085 SDs at two years (95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.11 to 0.28; 432 children; P = 0.2). 2.5.3 Underweight 2.5.3.1 Weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090for\u00e2\u0080\u0090age z\u00e2\u0080\u0090scores < \u00e2\u0080\u00932SD) Three cRCTs reported on the effects of CCTs on the proportion of children who were underweight (Kandpal 2016; Kusuma 2017a; Maluccio 2005). One study reported a clear effect favouring CCTs, and two studies reported unclear effects potentially favouring CCTs (Table 18). A meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis of these studies indicated that CCTs can help reduce underweight (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00934.87, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00938.65 to \u00e2\u0080\u00931.09; 2506 children; I2 = 0%; Analysis 2.9). The study clearly favouring CCTs was at low overall risk of bias. Two of these studies also reported the effects on severe stunting, showing the CCTs may not make a difference to this outcome (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00931.08, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00934.73 to 2.57; 1784 children; I2 = 0%; Analysis 2.10) (Kandpal 2016; Kusuma 2017a). In addition, Evans 2014, Kandpal 2016, and Macours 2012 reported on the effects of CCTs on mean WAZ. The pooled analysis indicated that CCTs slightly increased WAZ by 0.04 SDs in a period ranging from nine months to three years after the intervention (MD 0.04, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.03 to 0.11; 3 trials, 3,548 children; I2 = 0%; Analysis 2.11). Two of these studies were at high overall risk of bias (Evans 2014; Kandpal 2016). Prospective controlled studies One PCS, at high overall risk of bias, reported an unclear effect favouring the control (Ferre 2014). The proportion of children who were underweight increased by 4.6 pp at 13 months among those in the CCT group compared to the control group, but the effects ranged from a decrease to an increase (MD 0.05, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.05 to 0.14; 1638 children) (Table 19). 2.5.3.2 Body mass index\u00e2\u0080\u0090for\u00e2\u0080\u0090age z\u00e2\u0080\u0090score Cluster randomised controlled trials One cRCT at high overall risk of bias reported unclear effects on body mass index\u00e2\u0080\u0090for\u00e2\u0080\u0090age z\u00e2\u0080\u0090score (BMIZ) potentially favouring the control at 1.5 years (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00931.55, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00934.43 to 1.33; P > 0.1; 64 children aged 0 to 4 years; Table 18) (Evans 2014). Prospective controlled studies Two PCS, both at high overall risk of bias, reported on BMIZ, with effects ranging from unclear potentially favouring CCTs to unclear potentially favouring the control (P = 0.125) (Table 19) (Andersen 2015; Lopez Arana 2016). Studies could not be pooled due to high heterogeneity (I2 = 79%; Analysis 2.12). Both studies are at high overall risk of bias. In Lopez Arana 2016, some of the children also participated in a separate childcare supplementary nutrition programme, which could have influenced the effects of the cash transfer. This study included children aged from birth to 17 years, whereas Andersen 2015 included children aged six to 18 months only. Lopez Arana 2016 reported unclear effects potentially favouring CCTs, with BMIZ increasing for children in the intervention group compared to those in the control group (MD 0.14, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.27; P < 0.05; Table 19). Andersen 2015 reported unclear effects on BMIZ potentially favouring the control, both for those receiving the intervention for less than two years (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00930.03, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.31 to 0.25, P = 0.84) and those receiving it for longer than two years (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00930.36, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.79 to 0.06; P = 0.09) (Table 19). 2.6 Change in biochemical indicators No included study addressing this comparison reported biochemical indicators. 2.7 Cognitive function and development Two cRCTs (Baird 2013; Macours 2012) and one PCS (Andersen 2015) reported on cognitive function and development. Cluster randomised controlled trials Evidence from two cRCTs indicated that CCTs slightly improve cognitive function in children (2 RCTs, 5383 children; high\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence; Table 2; Figure 6) (Baird 2013; Macours 2012). Pooled effects indicated that CCTs slightly improve different measures of cognitive function compared to control (SMD 0.13, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.18; I2 = 0%; Analysis 2.13). The measure used in Macours 2012 was a combined measure averaging the effect across two language tests, short\u00e2\u0080\u0090 and long\u00e2\u0080\u0090term memory tests, and two behavioural tests. Baird 2013 used the Ravens Coloured Progressive Matrices test score, which is a measure of abstract reasons in children from the age of five years. For both of these, the higher the score, the more beneficial the effect. Prospective controlled studies Andersen 2015 reported small unclear effects potentially favouring the control on the TVIP score, which is the Spanish\u00e2\u0080\u0090speaking version of the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT), a test of receptive vocabulary that can be applied to children 36 months and older. The TVIP score was reduced by 0.15 SDs in the CCT group compared to the control group (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00930.15, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.37 to 0.07; 243 children; P = 0.17; Table 19). 2.8 Change in proportion of anxiety or depression One cRCT, at low overall risk of bias, reported on psychological distress, with effects ranging from clear effects favouring CCTs at one year to unclear effects potentially favouring CCTs at two years (Table 18) (Baird 2013). Psychological distress was assessed with the General Health\u00c2\u00a0Questionnaire 12, a tool used widely in clinical settings, in which psychological distress is a binary measure of psychological distress, anxiety and depression; social dysfunction; and loss of confidence. The study authors reported that the proportion of school girls with psychological distress reduced in the intervention group both at one year (pp \u00e2\u0080\u00930.06; 2089 girls; P < 0.05) and at two years (pp \u00e2\u0080\u00930.04; 2089 girls; P > 0.1). However, the change was very small and unlikely to be meaningful. This study was at low overall risk of bias. 2.9 Morbidity Four cRCTs report on various morbidity measures (Table 18) (Evans 2014; Gertler 2000 (PROGRESA); Kandpal 2016; Macours 2012). 2.9.1 Illness Three cRCTs reported the\u00c2\u00a0effects of CCTs on illness. A meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis of three of these studies indicated that CCTs may not make a difference to the proportion of people reporting being ill or that reporting seeking care for illness in the past two to four weeks (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00930.28, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00935.92 to 5.35; 38,587 participants; Analysis 2.14). Macours 2012 reported a clear effect favouring CCTs on the number of days ill in bed, which was lower among children in the CCT group compared to the control by 0.357 SDs (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00930.36, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.62 to \u00e2\u0080\u00930.10; 3326 children; Table 18). 2.9.2 Anaemia Gertler 2000 (PROGRESA) reported a clear effect favouring CCTs on anaemia. After 20 months of receiving the intervention, the odds of children being anaemic were 25.5% smaller in children receiving CCTs compared to those receiving no intervention (OR 0.75; 2010 children; P = 0.012). This study was at unclear overall risk of bias (Table 18). 2.10 Adverse outcomes (proportion of overweight/obesity) A meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis of two PCS, both at high overall risk of bias, showed that CCTs make no difference to the proportion of overweight children aged under 18 years at two to four years of the intervention (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.71; 3042 children; I2 = 60%; Analysis 2.15; Table 19) (Andersen 2015; Lopez Arana 2016). Lopez Arana 2016 also reported on the effects of CCTs on obesity. This study\u00c2\u00a0reported an unclear effect favouring CCTs; the risk of obesity was reduced by 44% among children in the intervention group at four years (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.53; 2874 children; P > 0.05). However, effects were uncertain as the CIs crossed the null effect. Comparison 3: income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation interventions Six cRCTs and 11 PCS assessed a variety of interventions aimed at generating income as a means to improve food security through increased economic access to food. Interventions included broad community development programmes that comprised training on livestock management, citizen empowerment, poverty alleviation delivered to women or women's self\u00e2\u0080\u0090help groups (Darrouzet Nardi 2016; Doocy 2017; Osei 2017), training programmes to improve farming practices and sustainable agriculture (Doocy 2017; Kangmennaang 2017), and access to savings and investments and building capacity of local governance structures (Weinhardt 2017). Other interventions aimed to generate income through one\u00e2\u0080\u0090off transfers of livestock with ongoing training (Asadullah 2015; Jodlowski 2016), and in some cases with additional intervention components such as health visits, access to community savings and technical advice (Asadullah 2015). Other studies focused on agriculture\u00e2\u0080\u0090related interventions as a means to generate income: through an integrated agriculture and nutrition programme including training and input provision for crop farming or animal rearing (Marquis 2018; Olney 2016), development of a sustainable integrated agriculture\u00e2\u0080\u0090aquaculture approaches (Murshed E Jahan 2011; Verbowski 2018), a sugarcane farmers scheme (Kennedy 1989), and implementation of a solar\u00e2\u0080\u0090powered irrigation systems (Alaofe 2016; Alaofe 2019). Three PCS evaluated employment interventions, including public works programmes (Porter 2016; Beegle 2017), and part\u00e2\u0080\u0090time employment for women (Katz 2001). Four PCS assessed effects on food security outcomes (Asadullah 2015; Doocy 2017; Kangmennaang 2017; Weinhardt 2017). Three cRCTs (Beegle 2017; Darrouzet Nardi 2016; Olney 2016) and three PCS (Alaofe 2019; Doocy 2017; Jodlowski 2016) reported various measures of dietary diversity. Four cRCTs (Darrouzet Nardi 2016; Marquis 2018; Olney 2016; Verbowski 2018) and five PCS (Alaofe 2019; Doocy 2017; Katz 2001; Kennedy 1989; Weinhardt 2017) reported on various anthropometric measures. One cRCT (Verbowski 2018) and three PCS (Alaofe 2019; Asadullah 2015; Kennedy 1989) reported on morbidity outcomes. Further details about the studies in this comparison are provided in Table 11. Results of individual trials included in this comparison are presented in Table 20 and PCS in Table 21. Table 3 and the harvest plot in Figure 7 summarise the effects on key outcomes. Primary outcomes 3.1 Change in the prevalence of undernourishment None of the included studies measured prevalence of undernourishment. 3.2 Proportion of household expenditure on food We found no evidence about the effect of income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation interventions on the proportion of household expenditure on food. Although two PCS mentioned this outcome in their manuscript, they did not report relevant numerical data or indicate clearly the direction of the effect (Alaofe 2016; Kennedy 1989). Four other PCS reported total expenditure on food, not in relation to income or total expenditure and these results are thus not reported here (Asadullah 2015; Jodlowski 2016; Katz 2001; Murshed E Jahan 2011). 3.3 Proportion of households who were food secure Two cRCTs reported the effects on food security of interventions where households received training for activities such as livestock management, aquaculture interventions and community development through women's self\u00e2\u0080\u0090help groups (Darrouzet Nardi 2016; Osei 2017), whereas two cRCTs assessed the effects of an integrated agriculture and nutrition programme (Olney 2016; Marquis 2018). In one cRCT, households participated in a public works programme in Malawi (Beegle 2017). Six PCS assessing different interventions reported different food security or dietary diversity measures (Alaofe 2019; Asadullah 2015; Doocy 2017; Jodlowski 2016; Kangmennaang 2017; Weinhardt 2017). 3.3.1 Food security Cluster randomised controlled trials Evidence from one cRCT suggested that income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation interventions may result in little to no difference in food security of households who receive these interventions, compared to households who do not (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00930.06, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.22 to 0.1; 2193 households; low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence; Table 3). A cRCT from Malawi showed an unclear effect potentially favouring the control on household food security scores, after three to four months (Figure 7) (Beegle 2017). One RCT did not report an overall effect estimate for the proportion of households experiencing food security (based on HFIAS) after 2.5 years, following the implementation of an agricultural and nutrition training programme in women from rural villages In Nepal (Osei 2017). Prospective controlled studies Three PCS reported clear effects favouring the intervention on measures of food security and one PCS reported unclear effects favouring the intervention (P = 0.01) (Figure 7). Asadullah 2015, Doocy 2017, and Kangmennaang 2017 reported a clear effect favouring the intervention. In Asadullah 2015, among participants receiving a multicomponent intervention including training and transfer of productive assets for an income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation enterprise, the proportion of households that reported always experiencing a food deficit decreased compared to the control group over a period of nine years (at 3 years: pp \u00e2\u0080\u009328.85; P < 0.01; at 6 years: pp \u00e2\u0080\u009317.15; P < 0.0; at 9 years: pp \u00e2\u0080\u009313.91; P < 0.01; all 4038 households). In Doocy 2017, the combined effect of both groups of the interventions (where farmer field schools and women empowerment groups in farming villages) showed a clear effect favouring the intervention, with a decrease in mean HFIAS compared to control villages not receiving any intervention (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00934.23, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00934.96 to \u00e2\u0080\u00933.49; 1119 households). In Kangmennaang 2017, the implementation of a training and development programme for farmers resulted in a clear effect favouring the intervention, with a decrease in mean HFIAS in intervention households compared to control households (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00930.30; 1000 households; P < 0.01) (Table 21). These studies could not be pooled due to high heterogeneity (I2 = 99%; Analysis 3.1). Both studies are at high overall risk of bias. The interventions differed. Doocy 2017 assessed a programme including women empowerment groups, where weekly meetings and training were provided regularly as well as start\u00e2\u0080\u0090up materials, and farmer field schools, where farmers received semi\u00e2\u0080\u0090monthly training in farming practices as well as business and administration. Kangmennaang 2017 assessed an intervention in which farmers experimented with agroecological innovations and which also included sharing knowledge and training on various aspects including leadership. Weinhardt 2017 reported an unclear effect potentially favouring the intervention. This study assessed a multilevel health and development intervention including training on farming practices, and access to VSLs groups. The odds of being food secure (i.e. household that had zero months where there was insufficient food to meet their needs in the previous 12 months) increased by 36% at 1.5 years (OR 1.36, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.97; 827 participants; P = 0.108) and 12% at three years (OR 1.12, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.67; 827 participants; P = 0.585). 3.3.2 Dietary diversity Four cRCTs (Beegle 2017; Darrouzet Nardi 2016; Marquis 2018; Olney 2016) and three PCS (Alaofe 2019; Doocy 2017; Jodlowski 2016) reported on seven different measures of dietary diversity. Definitions and explanations of dietary diversity measures reported here are provided in Table 12. Cluster randomised controlled trials Evidence from four RCTs suggests that income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation interventions may improve dietary diversity in children and may result in little or no difference to household dietary diversity (4 cRCTs, 3677 households and 3790 children; low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence; Table 3). Two cRCTs reported a clear effect favouring income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation interventions (Darrouzet Nardi 2016; Marquis 2018), one reported an unclear effect favouring the intervention (Olney 2016), and one reported an unclear effect favouring the control group (Beegle 2017) (P = 0.047; Figure 7). A meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis of two of these trials, assessing a public works programme in Malawi and an integrated agriculture and nutrition programme including provision of inputs and training, showed that income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation interventions make no difference to the HDDSs at three months to two years (SMD 0.02, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.09 to 0.13; 3677 households; I2 = 63%; Analysis 3.2) (Beegle 2017; Olney 2016). Beegle 2017 was at high and Olney 2016 at unclear overall risk of bias. Beegle 2017 measured dietary diversity using the FCS (scale: 0 to 126) and Olney 2016 used the HDDS (scale: 0 to 11); for both, the higher the score, the higher the food diversity. Another meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis of three of these cRCTs, assessing the implementation of women's groups, agricultural and nutritional training, and community development, showed that children in intervention households were 1.28 times more likely to achieve MDD, compared to children from control households, one to two years after the implementation of the interventions (OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.47; 3790 children; Analysis 3.3) (Darrouzet Nardi 2016; Marquis 2018; Olney 2016). Marquis 2018 was at low overall risk of bias and Darrouzet Nardi 2016 and Olney 2016 were at unclear overall risk of bias. Prospective controlled studies Two PCS reported a clear effect favouring income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation interventions and one study reported an unclear effect potentially favouring income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation interventions on dietary diversity (Figure 7). A meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis of these studies indicated that income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation interventions increase the HDDS (MD 0.67, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.05; 1571 households; I2 = 67%; Analysis 3.4) (Alaofe 2019; Doocy 2017; Jodlowski 2016). Doocy 2017 assessed farmer field schools or women's empowerment groups at 3.5 years, Alaofe 2019 assessed the installation of a low\u00e2\u0080\u0090pressure drip irrigation system, combined with a solar\u00e2\u0080\u0090powered water pump in each intervention village, and Jodlowski 2016 assessed a livestock transfer with training support. All studies were at high overall risk of bias. Secondary outcomes 3.4 Change in adequacy of dietary intake Prospective controlled studies Although one PCS reported two measures of dietary intake adequacy among participants of an intervention where smallholder sugarcane growers were enrolled in a scheme to provide sugarcane to a new factory, the study authors did not report any effect measures (Kennedy 1989). 3.5 Change in anthropometric indicators Four cRCTs (Darrouzet Nardi 2016; Olney 2016; Osei 2017; Verbowski 2018) and six PCS (Alaofe 2019; Asadullah 2015; Doocy 2017; Katz 2001; Kennedy 1989; Weinhardt 2017) reported nine different anthropometric measures in children and women. 3.5.1 Stunting: height\u00e2\u0080\u0090for\u00e2\u0080\u0090age z\u00e2\u0080\u0090scores < \u00e2\u0080\u00932SD (chronic undernutrition) Four cRCTs (Darrouzet Nardi 2016; Osei 2017; Marquis 2018; Verbowski 2018) and two PCS (Doocy 2017; Kennedy 1989) reported on stunting. Cluster randomised controlled trials Evidence from two trials indicated that income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation interventions probably make little or no difference to wasting (2 trials, 3500 children; moderate\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence; Table 3) (Osei 2017; Verbowski 2018). A meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis of these two studies showed no difference to stunting (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.19; I2 = 0%; Analysis 3.5). In addition to reporting the proportion of children who are stunted, Marquis 2018, Darrouzet Nardi 2016, and Osei 2017 reported on the effect of income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation interventions on mean HAZ. Data from these studies could not be pooled due to high heterogeneity (I2 = 100%; Analysis 3.6). Marquis 2018 was at low overall risk of bias whereas Darrouzet Nardi 2016 and Osei 2017 were at unclear risk. All three studies assessed some form of training on agricultural practices or livestock management but, in all but one (Darrouzet Nardi 2016), nutrition and health education sessions were also provided, with which the most beneficial effects were observed. If this study was removed from the meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis, heterogeneity reduced to 0%. All three studies reported a clear effect favouring income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation interventions at 1 to 2.5 years of follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up. In Marquis 2018, the mean HAZ increased by 0.22 SD with the intervention at 12 months (95% CI 0.10 to 0.34; 428 children); the study assessed an integrated package of agricultural inputs and training as well as education in nutrition, health care and child stimulation for participants. In Darrouzet Nardi 2016, it increased by 0.03 SD in the intervention group, which included training for poverty alleviation, citizen empowerment, community development and optimisation of livestock management as means to generate income (95% CI 0.02 to 0.04; 609 children). However, the effect was unclear potentially favouring the intervention at one year. In Osei 2017, which assessed an enhanced homestead food production (EHFP) programme encompassing training in improved gardening and poultry\u00e2\u0080\u0090rearing practices, among others, it increased by 0.22 SD at 2.5 years (95% CI 0.22 to 0.22; 2569 children) (Table 20). Prospective controlled studies Two PCS reported on stunting (Doocy 2017; Kennedy 1989). One study, assessing an income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation intervention with women's groups and farmer field schools, reported an unclear effect potentially favouring the control, with an increase in the proportion of stunted children at 3.5 years (MD 1.4, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u009310.7 to 13.6; P = 0.81, 471 children) (Table 21) (Doocy 2017). The other study did report any effect measures (Kennedy 1989). 3.5.2 Wasting: weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090for\u00e2\u0080\u0090height z\u00e2\u0080\u0090scores < \u00e2\u0080\u00932SD (acute undernutrition) Three cRCTs (Marquis 2018; Osei 2017; Verbowski 2018) and one PCS (Kennedy 1989) reported on wasting. Cluster randomised controlled trials Evidence indicated that income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation interventions probably make little or no difference to wasting (2 cRCTs, 3500 children; moderate\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence; Table 3). A meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis of these two cRCTs showed an unclear effect potentially favouring the control, with an increased risk of wasting in children in the intervention group at two years (OR 1.13 95% CI 0.92 to 1.40; I2 = 0%; Analysis 3.7) (Osei 2017; Verbowski 2018). In addition, Marquis 2018 and Osei 2017 reported on the effects of income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation interventions on the mean WHZ. Data could not be pooled due to high heterogeneity (I2 = 85%; Analysis 3.8). Marquis 2018 reported a clear effect favouring the control (MD 0.07, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.087 to 0.227; 429 children), and Osei 2017 reported an unclear effect favouring the income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation intervention (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00930.14, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.142 to \u00e2\u0080\u00930.138; 2603 children) (Table 20). 3.5.3 Underweight 3.5.3.1 Weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090for\u00e2\u0080\u0090age z\u00e2\u0080\u0090scores < \u00e2\u0080\u00932SD Three cRCTs (Darrouzet Nardi 2016; Marquis 2018; Osei 2017) and three PCS (Doocy 2017; Kennedy 1989; Weinhardt 2017) reported on weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090for\u00e2\u0080\u0090age measures. Cluster randomised controlled trials A meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis of two cRCTs showed that income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation interventions make little or no difference to the percentage of children who are underweight in households that receive the intervention compared to households that did not, after two years follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up (MD 1.06, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.26; 3808 children; I2 = 4%; Analysis 3.9) (Osei 2017; Verbowski 2018). In addition, three cRCTs reported on the effect of income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation interventions on WAZ (Darrouzet Nardi 2016; Marquis 2018; Osei 2017). Data could not be pooled due to high heterogeneity (I2 = 99%; Analysis 3.10). Two studies reported a clear effect favouring income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation interventions and Osei 2017 reported no effect at 2.5 years (MD 0.00, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.00 to 0.00; 2613 children). Prospective controlled studies Two studies reported on the effects of income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation interventions on the percentage of children who were underweight (Doocy 2017; Weinhardt 2017). A meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis of these studies showed that these interventions make no difference to the percentage of children who are underweight (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.12; 909 children; I2 = 16%; Analysis 3.11). No effect measures could be calculated for Kennedy 1989. 3.5.3.2 Body mass index Two cRCTs (Olney 2016; Osei 2017) and three PCS (Alaofe 2019; Asadullah 2015; Kennedy 1989) reported on BMI measures in women. Cluster randomised controlled trials Two cRCTs reported a clear effect favouring income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation interventions on the proportion of women who were underweight (BMI< 18.5 kg/m2) (Olney 2016; Osei 2017) and one study reported an unclear effect potentially favouring the control (Verbowski 2018) (P = 0.047). Data could not be pooled due to high heterogeneity (I2 = 80%; Analysis 3.12). Heterogeneity seemed to be driven by Verbowski 2018, which was the only study with an aquaculture component in the intervention. All three studies were a variation of the EHFP intervention, so similar in other characteristics. Olney 2016 and Osei 2017 reported a clear effect favouring income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation interventions. Olney 2016 reported that the proportion of underweight women in the intervention group was 8.7 pp lower compared to the control group at two years (1297 women; P = 0.01). Osei 2017 reported reduced odds of underweight among women in the intervention group by 39% at two years (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.82; 2614 mothers) (Table 20). Both studies were at unclear overall risk of bias. Verbowski 2018 reported an unclear effect potentially favouring the control, with the proportion of underweight women being higher in the intervention group by 3.88 pp (95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00934.36 to 12.12; 911 women) (Table 20). This study was at unclear overall risk of bias. In addition Olney 2016 and Osei 2017 reported on the mean BMI in women. A meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis of these two cRCTs reported little or no effect on the mean BMI of women from households who received income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation interventions, such as integrated agriculture and nutrition programmes or community development programmes, compared to women from households who did not, after two years of follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00930.02, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.28 to 0.25; 2 RCTs, 3911 women; Analysis 3.13). Prospective controlled studies One PCS reported an unclear effect on the proportion of underweight women in the villages with the intervention, compared to women from villages who did not, after one year of follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00930.22, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.75 to 0.31; 359 women) (Table 21) (Alaofe 2019). Three studies reported on the effect on mean BMI in women. Effect measures for mean BMI could not be calculated for one PCS (Kennedy 1989). The other two studies reported an unclear effect potentially favouring the intervention (P = 0.063). Asadullah 2015 did not report the variance of effect for mean BMI of women (MD 0.14; P = 0.29). Alaofe 2019 reported an unclear effect on the mean BMI of women, favouring the intervention (the installation of solar\u00e2\u0080\u0090powered irrigation systems), compared to the mean BMI of women from households in villages where the technology was not available, after one year of follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up (difference in differences (DID) 0.43, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.05 to 0.89; 359 women; P < 0.1). 3.5.4 Mid\u00e2\u0080\u0090upper arm circumference One PCS reported no difference in the mean MUAC of women who were part of an employment intervention compared to women in the control group, in Nepal at two years; the mean change in the intervention group was \u00e2\u0080\u00930.20 cm and in the control group was \u00e2\u0080\u00930.25 cm (718 women; P = 0.67) (Katz 2001). 3.6 Change in biochemical indicators Two cRCTs reported biochemical indicators, such as haemoglobin levels in women and children (Osei 2017; Verbowski 2018), and one PCS reported iron and vitamin A deficiency in women (Alaofe 2019). Cluster randomised controlled trials A meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis of two cRCTs showed a clear effect on mean haemoglobin levels in children, favouring income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation interventions (MD 3.49, 95% CI 3.25 to 3.72; 2 RCTs, 3808 children; Analysis 3.14) (Osei 2017; Verbowski 2018). We could not pool the data for women due to high heterogeneity (I2 = 96%; Analysis 3.15). Osei 2017 reported a clear effect on haemoglobin levels favouring income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation interventions at 2.5 years (MD 4.6, 95% CI 4.59 to 4.61; 2614 mothers), whereas Verbowski 2018 reported an unclear effect potentially favouring the control (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00930.07, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00931.92 to 1.78; 811 women) (Table 20). Both studies were at unclear overall risk of bias. Prospective controlled studies Alaofe 2019 reported unclear effects favouring the intervention (the installation of solar\u00e2\u0080\u0090powered irrigation systems) for the proportion of women with iron deficiency (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00930.11, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.94 to 0.72; 68 women; P > 0.05), and favouring the control for the proportion of women with vitamin A deficiency (MD 0.54, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.41 to 1.49; P > 0.05; 60 women) (Table 21). 3.7 Cognitive function and development None of the studies included in this comparison reported cognitive function and development. 3.8 Change in proportion of anxiety or depression None of the studies included in this comparison reported proportion of anxiety or depression. 3.9 Morbidity Cluster randomised controlled trials Two cRCTs report on morbidity measures, such as the prevalence of anaemia in women and children (Osei 2017; Verbowski 2018). A meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis of these showed a clear effect favouring income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation interventions on the proportion of children with anaemia, after two years of follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.88; 2 RCTs, 3808 children; Analysis 3.16). However, in women, these interventions resulted in an unclear effect favouring the control after follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up for two years (OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.38; 2 RCTs, 3696 women; Analysis 3.17). Prospective controlled studies Three PCS reported unclear effects different morbidity measures (Alaofe 2019; Asadullah 2015; Kennedy 1989). Asadullah 2015 reported an unclear effect potentially favouring the intervention in the proportion of household members reporting serious illness in the previous year, over nine years of the intervention, with this proportion reducing both in the intervention and the control group (3 years: pp \u00e2\u0080\u00931.72, P > 0.1; 6 years: pp \u00e2\u0080\u00930.78, P > 0.1; 9 years: pp \u00e2\u0080\u00930.70, P > 0.1; 4038 households). This study is at high overall risk of bias. Kennedy 1989 reported a higher percentage of time being ill among those in the intervention group (sugarcane growers scheme) at two years; both for children (29.8% with intervention versus 31.2% with control; 1055 children) and for women (23.8 with intervention versus 24.3% with control; 420 women). In terms of the percent of time children were ill with diarrhoea, this was higher in the intervention group at two years (4.6 with intervention versus 4.0% with control; 1055 children). However, the study reported no baseline values or effect measures, which was at unclear overall risk of bias. Alaofe 2019 reported a clear effect favouring income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation interventions on the prevalence of anaemia in women from intervention households, compared to control households (at 1 year: MD \u00e2\u0080\u00931.25, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00931.83 to \u00e2\u0080\u00930.67; 126 women; P = 0.05); the effect was unclear favouring the intervention for the prevalence of iron\u00e2\u0080\u0090deficiency anaemia in women from intervention households compared to control households (at 1 year: MD \u00e2\u0080\u00930.99, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00932.39 to 0.41; 546 women; P > 0.05). 3.10 Adverse outcomes (proportion of overweight/obesity) None of the studies included in this comparison reported proportion of overweight/obesity. Comparison 4: food prices \u00e2\u0080\u0093 food vouchers Three cRCTs (Fenn 2015; Hidrobo 2014; Ponce 2017) and one RCT (Jensen 2011) reported the effects of food vouchers compared to no intervention. Food vouchers are provided to households or individuals for the purchase of food, which could be specific to particular foods or for any foods, and usually can be redeemed at specific vendors. Hidrobo 2014 provided vouchers to households, to the value of USD 40 per month, that could be redeemed at specific supermarkets in urban areas in Ecuador for nutritionally approved foods within 30 days of receiving the vouchers. Participants in this study also had to attend monthly nutrition sensitisation sessions. Fenn 2015 provided monthly fresh food vouchers with a cash value of 1500 PKR (approximately USD 14), which could be exchanged for specified fresh foods (fruits, vegetables, milk and meat) in nominated shops in Pakistan. Vouchers were distributed at specific distribution points either by mobile banks that travelled to a central location serving some of the participating villages or through central banks that served a number of villages. In Ponce 2017, households in Ecuador received a food voucher of USD 40 monthly. In Jensen 2011, a month's supply of vouchers entitled participants to a price reduction of the local staple food to the value of 750 g per person per day of that staple food. More details on these studies are available in Table 22 and in the Characteristics of included studies table. Hidrobo 2014 and Ponce 2017 reported dietary diversity measures. Fenn 2015 reported anthropometric measures. Jensen 2011 reported adequacy of dietary intake measures. Results from individual studies are reported in Table 23 and the harvest plot is presented in Figure 8. Primary outcomes 4.1 Change in the prevalence of undernourishment None of the included trials reported prevalence of undernourishment. 4.2 Proportion of household expenditure on food None of the included trials reported household expenditure on food. 4.3 Proportion of households who were food secure 4.3.1 Dietary diversity Evidence from two trials reported that food vouchers may improve dietary diversity slightly (2 RCT, 2459 households; low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence; Table 4) (Hidrobo 2014; Ponce 2017). Both studies reported clear effects favouring the intervention (P = 0.063; Figure 8). In Hidrobo 2014, at seven months, among households in the food voucher group the FCS was higher by 9.4 points (out of maximum score of 112) (95% CI 6.6 to 12.2; 2087 households; P < 0.01). Other measures of dietary diversity reported in Hidrobo 2014 also indicate clear effects favouring food vouchers (Table 23). In Ponce 2017, the FCS increased by 0.39 points in the intervention group (95% CI 0.30 to 0.49). Pooled analysis was not possible because numbers per group were not reported for Hidrobo 2014 and thus SMD could not be calculated (Analysis 4.1). Both studies were at high overall risk of bias. Secondary outcomes 4.4 Change in adequacy of dietary intake Jensen 2011 reported an unclear effect potentially favouring the control on the mineral and vitamin sufficiency indices (Table 23). These indices reflect the mean intake per person relative to the Dietary Reference Intake (DRI). Among households in the intervention group, there was a reduction in the mineral sufficiency index compared to the control group (percentage change \u00e2\u0080\u00930.06, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.22 to 0.10), and a reduction in the vitamin sufficiency index (percentage change \u00e2\u0080\u00930.05, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.22 to 0.12) at five months. However, the CIs crossed the null. This study was at low overall risk of bias. 4.5 Change in anthropometric indicators One cRCT reported on stunting, wasting and underweight (Fenn 2015). This study was at low overall risk of bias. 4.5.1 Stunting: height\u00e2\u0080\u0090for\u00e2\u0080\u0090age z\u00e2\u0080\u0090scores < \u00e2\u0080\u00932SD Fenn 2015 reported that food vouchers probably reduce stunting (1 trial; moderate\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence; Table 4). At 12 months' follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up, the odds of stunting was 52% less in the food voucher group compared to control. This study reported a similar effect on other measures of stunting; it reported a reduction in the proportion of children who are severely stunted (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.79; 1633 children), and an increase in the mean HAZ at 12 months (MD 0.29, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.40; 1633 children; Table 23). 4.5.2 Wasting: weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090for\u00e2\u0080\u0090height z\u00e2\u0080\u0090scores < \u00e2\u0080\u00932SD Fenn 2015 reported that food vouchers may result in little to no difference in wasting (1 trial, 1633 children; low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence; Table 4). At 12 months of follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up, it reported an unclear effect potentially favouring the control (Figure 8); the odds of stunting were 17% higher in the food voucher group compared to the control; however, this effect ranged from 25% reduction to an 82% increased odds of stunting. Similar effects are reported for severe wasting at six months (OR 1.27, 95% CI 0.45 to 3.55; 1643 children); however, for mean WHZ they reported unclear effect favouring the food vouchers at 12 months (coefficient 0.02, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.1 to 0.14; 1633 children; Table 23). 4.5.3 Underweight Fenn 2015 reported two different measures of underweight. In children, it reported an unclear effect on MUAC at six months (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00930.05, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.14 to 0.04; 1643 children). In mothers, they reported a clear effect on BMI favouring food vouchers (MD 0.29 kg/m2, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.54; 1204 mothers; Table 23). 4.6 Change in biochemical indicators None of the included trials reported biochemical indicators. 4.7 Cognitive function and development None of the included trials reported cognitive function and development. 4.8 Change in proportion of anxiety or depression None of the included trials reported proportion of anxiety or depression. 4.9 Morbidity None of the included trials reported morbidity. 4.10 Adverse outcomes (proportion of overweight/obesity) None of the included trials reported proportion of overweight/obesity. Comparison 5: food prices \u00e2\u0080\u0093 food and nutrition subsidies One cRCT (Chen 2019) and three PCS (Andaleeb 2016; Chakrabarti 2018; Sturm 2013) assessed the effects of food and nutrition subsidies. These interventions aim to address rising food prices by reducing the price of the foods for the consumer, and are usually provided by the government. Chen 2019 assessed the provision of a one\u00e2\u0080\u0090off nutrition subsidy with a monetary equivalent of CYN 225 (USD 33) per enrolled student to schools in China, which they could use for nutrition\u00e2\u0080\u0090related expenses (e.g. buying food). Schoolmasters received information about the proportion of enrolled students who were anaemic; elective methods for reducing iron\u00e2\u0080\u0090deficient anaemia; and details about anaemia's relation with school attendance, educational performance, and cognitive development. Andaleeb 2016 assessed the public distribution system (PDS) in India, in which households with a ration card were eligible for 25 kg of subsidised rice. A ration card was a document issued by the government which entitled an individual/family to purchase from the PDS, and which was also used as an identity card for other government schemes. Chakrabarti 2018 also assessed the PDS in India, but this study subsidised a variety of pulses in different districts as part of the PDS, in addition to the usual subsidising of rice, wheat, sugar and kerosene oil. Sturm 2013 assessed cash rebates on food purchases. It reports on the HealthyFood programme, which provides a rebate between 10% and 25% on healthy food purchases in designated supermarkets in South Africa for members of the Vitality programme of Discovery Health Insurance scheme. More details about this study are available in Table 17 and in the Characteristics of included studies table. Chen 2019 reported on dietary diversity, anthropometric, biochemical and morbidity measures. Sturm 2013 reported on the proportion of household expenditure on food. Andaleeb 2016 reported on adequacy of dietary intake. Although Chakrabarti 2018 reported food security, dietary diversity and the proportion of household expenditure on food, it did not report any relevant measure under any of these outcome domains. Further details of these studies are presented in Table 22. Results of included trials are presented in Table 24 and PCS in Table 25. The harvest plot is presented in Figure 9. Primary outcomes 5.1 Change in the prevalence of undernourishment None of the included studies measured prevalence of undernourishment. 5.2 Proportion of household expenditure on food Evidence from one study was very uncertain about the effects of food rebates on household expenditure on healthy foods (1 study, 169,485 households; very low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence; Table 5) (Sturm 2013). This study reported clear effects favouring cash rebates on proportion of healthy to total household food expenditure (Figure 9). The study authors reported that food rebates increased the ratio of healthy to total food expenditure: the 10% rebated increased it by 6% at three years (95% CI 5.3 to 6.8; 169,485 households), and the 25% rebate increased it by 9.3% at two years and four months (95% CI 8.5 to 10.0; 136,484 households) (Table 25). This study was at high overall risk of bias due to high risk of selection bias. 5.3 Proportion of households who were food secure One cRCT reported the effects of nutrition subsidies on dietary diversity (Chen 2019). 5.3.1 Dietary diversity Evidence from one trial indicated that nutrition subsidies may improve dietary diversity among school children (1 RCT, 656 children; low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence; Table 5) (Chen 2019). This study reported a clear effect favouring nutrition subsidies (Figure 9); at six months, the dietary diversity score of school children in the subsidy group increased 0.956 points more (almost one more food group) more than in the control group (MD 0.96, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.45). This study was at high overall risk of bias. Secondary outcomes 5.4 Change in adequacy of dietary intake Andaleeb 2016 reported on the adequacy of dietary intake for energy, protein and fat (Table 25). At seven years, it reported a clear effect favouring food subsidies for the ratio of protein intake to the recommended daily allowance (RDA) (DID 3.75, 95% CI 0.52 to 6.98; n = NR), an unclear effect potentially favouring food subsidies for the ratio of current caloric intake to the RDA (DID 2.55, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.02 to 5.12; n = NR), and unclear effects potentially favouring the control on the ratio of fat intake to the RDA (DID \u00e2\u0080\u00930.1, SE 0.00; P > 0.1). 5.5 Change in anthropometric indicators Chen 2019 reported on anthropometric indicators. 5.5.1 Underweight (body mass index z\u00e2\u0080\u0090score < \u00e2\u0080\u00932SD) Chen 2019 reported an unclear effect potentially favouring nutrition subsidies (Table 24). The proportion of underweight children reduced in the schools receiving the nutrition subsidy by 3.2 pp compared to the control schools; however, the CIs crossed the null (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00930.03, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.08 to 0.02, 656 children). There was a similar effect in mean BMIZ (Table 24). In the group where a monetary incentive was provided if the school achieved the desired targets, the effect was similar for the proportion of children who were underweight, but it clearly favoured nutrition subsidies for BMIZ. This study was at high overall risk of bias. 5.6 Change in biochemical indicators 5.6.1 Haemoglobin Chen 2019 reported an unclear effect potentially favouring the intervention at six months on the mean concentration of haemoglobin in school children (MD 0.51, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00932.13 to 3.15; n = 656; Table 24). Adding a monetary incentive resulted in a clear effect favouring nutrition subsidies (MD 4.49, 95% CI 2.06 to 6.92). 5.7 Cognitive function and development None of the included studies measured cognitive function and development. 5.8 Change in proportion of anxiety or depression None of the included studies measured anxiety or depression. 5.9 Morbidity 5.9.1 Anaemia Chen 2019 reported an unclear effect potentially favouring nutrition subsidies on the proportion of school children with anaemia at six months (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00930.005, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.1 to 0.09). Adding a monetary incentive resulted in a clear effect favouring nutrition subsidies (Table 24). This study was at high overall risk of bias. 5.10 Adverse outcomes (proportion of overweight/obesity) None of the included studies measured overweight/obesity. Comparison 6: social support Two included studies assessed social support interventions. One cRCT in Indonesia randomised subdistricts to receive a community cash grant or to a control group, which were linked to health and education conditionalities (Kusuma 2017b). Two intervention groups were implemented, one with and one without a performance incentive, but the effect of both is reported together. One PCS randomised households either to a VSL group or to a VSL and Ajuda Mutua (AM) group, or to a control group (Brunie 2014). VSLs are self\u00e2\u0080\u0090managed and capitalised microfinance programmes where members pool savings and can borrow from the pool and repay with interest. AM is a rotating labour scheme, where groups of households work together on each family's land or enterprise on a rotational basis. A combined effect of both groups is reported. Kusuma 2017b reported effects on anthropometric indicators, and Brunie 2014 reported effects on measures of food security, dietary diversity and anthropometry. Further details about these studies are presented in Table 22 and in the Characteristics of included studies table. Results from these studies are presented in Table 26 and Table 27, and in the harvest plot in Figure 10. Primary outcomes 6.1 Change in the prevalence of undernourishment None of the included studies measured prevalence of undernourishment. 6.2 Proportion of household expenditure on food None of the included studies measured household expenditure on food. 6.3 Proportion of households who were food secure One PCS reported on food security and dietary diversity measures (Brunie 2014). 6.3.1 Food security The evidence was very uncertain about the effects of VSLs on food security (MD 1.25, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.28 to 2.79; 851 households; very low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence; Table 6; Figure 10). Brunie 2014 reported an unclear effect potentially favouring the VSL intervention on the number of self\u00e2\u0080\u0090reported months of food sufficiency in the previous year, with an increase by 1.25 months in the intervention group at three years (Table 27). 6.3.2 Dietary diversity The evidence was very uncertain about the effects of VSLs on dietary diversity (1 study, 802 households; very low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence; Table 6; Figure 10). Brunie 2014 reported an unclear effect on household dietary diversity favouring the control (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00930.30, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00931.46 to 0.87; 1615 households) (Table 27). Brunie 2014 also reported on Individual Dietary Diversity Scores (IDDS) among children: IDDS was slightly higher by 0.81 points (out of 12) in the VSL group (MD 0.52, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.18 to 1.23; 1121 children) (Table 27). Secondary outcomes 6.4 Change in adequacy of dietary intake None of the included studies measured adequacy of dietary intake. 6.5 Change in anthropometric indicators One trial reported on stunting, wasting and underweight measures (Kusuma 2017b). One PCS reported on underweight measures (Brunie 2014). 6.5.1 Stunting (height\u00e2\u0080\u0090for\u00e2\u0080\u0090age z\u00e2\u0080\u0090scores < \u00e2\u0080\u00932SD) Community grants may make little or no difference to stunting (1 trial, 1481 children; low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence; Table 6; Figure 10). Kusuma 2017b reported an unclear effect on stunting favouring the control (3.4 pp, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00937.4 to 14.2; 1481 children aged 24 to 36 months). The effect on severe stunting (HAZ < \u00e2\u0080\u00933SD) was different: they reported an unclear effect favouring the community cash grants (\u00e2\u0080\u00936 pp, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u009316.4 to 4.4; 1481 children aged 24 to 36 months; Table 26). 6.5.2 Wasting (weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090for\u00e2\u0080\u0090height z\u00e2\u0080\u0090scores < \u00e2\u0080\u00932SD) Community grants probably make little or no difference to wasting (1 RCT, 1481 children; moderate\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence; Table 6; Figure 10). Kusuma 2017b reported an unclear effect favouring the intervention at two years (\u00e2\u0080\u00931.0 pp, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00937.9 to 5.9). The effect on severe wasting (WHZ < \u00e2\u0080\u00933SD) was similar (\u00e2\u0080\u00932.1 pp, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00937 to 2.8; Table 26). 6.5.3 Underweight: weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090for\u00e2\u0080\u0090age z\u00e2\u0080\u0090scores < \u00e2\u0080\u00932SD Randomised controlled trials Kusuma 2017b reported an unclear effect on stunting favouring community cash grants (\u00e2\u0080\u00932 pp, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u009311.9 to 7.9; 1481 children). The effect on severe underweight (WAZ < \u00e2\u0080\u00933SD) was similar (Table 26). This study was at unclear overall risk of bias. Prospective controlled studies Brunie 2014 reported an unclear effect on WAZ potentially favouring the VSL intervention (with or without a rotating labour scheme). Among children in the intervention group, the mean WAZ increased slightly by 0.05 SDs compared to the control group at three years (MD 0.05, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00930.37 to 0.48; 1053 children; Table 27). 6.6 Change in biochemical indicators None of the included studies measured biochemical indicators. 6.7 Cognitive function and development None of the included studies measured cognitive function and development. 6.8 Change in proportion of anxiety or depression None of the included studies measured anxiety or depression. 6.9 Morbidity None of the included studies measured morbidity. 6.10 Adverse outcomes (proportion of overweight/obesity) None of the included studies measured proportion of overweight/obesity.",

Summary of PICOS and of AMSTAR scores of included systematic reviews, and how existing reviews informed the PICOS of a new Cochrane Review Domain\tFinding\tHow it informed our review question or methods\t \tSetting\t12 reviews did not specify the setting11 reviews stated the community as the setting3 reviews stated the setting was LMICs3 reviews specified a school as the setting\tWe chose the community as the setting, defined as a group of people with diverse characteristics who were linked by social ties, share common perspectives and engage in joint action in geographical locations or settings (MacQueen 2001).\t \tParticipants\t5 reviews did not specify the types of participants for inclusion11 reviews included infants and children (up to school\u00e2\u0080\u0090aged children)1 review included adults and adolescents6 reviews included pregnant women or mothers in the immediate postpartum period. 1 of these also targeted other adults who could be linked to women who may have breastfed. Many of these were assessing interventions on breastfeeding or complementary feeding.1 review included only parents of children aged 2\u00e2\u0080\u00935 years, as it assessed influence of parenting practices on children's dietary habits2 reviews included all people living in a community3 reviews included only poor people who were recipients of some service, e.g. recipients of a government conditional cash\u00e2\u0080\u0090transfer programme\tAs existing reviews specifically addressed specific high\u00e2\u0080\u0090risk groups, we did not focus on these. Instead, we included all individuals across all ages that belonged to the community where relevant interventions had been implemented.\t \tIntervention (including its duration)\t14 reviews addressed interventions related to the availability of food, 5 of which also assessed interventions influencing utilisation of food, such as nutrition education13 reviews assessed interventions addressing food utilisation7 reviews assessed interventions addressing access to food (2 of which had a low AMSTAR score of 4)28 reviews did not specify the duration of the intervention, and only 1 included interventions with a minimum duration of 3 months. As a result, the duration and the follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up times of the interventions varied considerably within and across reviews\tOf the 14 reviews that addressed food availability, 5 also assessed food utilisation (e.g. combination of community gardens and nutrition education). As fewer reviews addressed food access, we included interventions that had addressed this dimension of food security.We included interventions with any duration but extracted outcomes that were measured \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 3 months after implementation.\t \tControl\t18 reviews did not specify a control group6 reviews compared the intervention with either no intervention, an alternative intervention or placebo3 reviews did not have any control group2 reviews stated that included studies needed to have a control group, but did not specify further\tWe included studies in which these interventions, individually or in combination, were compared to no intervention or to other eligible intervention.\t \tOutcomes assessed\tThe specific outcomes assessed across the included reviews varied considerably and often they were not clearly specified at the outset.The most common and important outcomes reported in these reviews were related to dietary intake, anthropometric measurements, and biochemical and clinical indicators, to describe the impact of the intervention on nutritional status. Other outcomes measured included food purchase or expenditure, food production, morbidity and mortality, and breastfeeding initiation rates or duration.Often, reviews measured the same outcome in different ways. For example, anthropometric indicators assessed differed, as did their classifications, across the included reviews. This makes it difficult to compare results across reviews and to reach a conclusion about the effectiveness of a specific intervention.\tThe most commonly specified outcomes measured food and nutrition security, and nutritional status. We also focused on these outcomes. Examples included: diet diversity scores and hunger measures; and anthropometric, biochemical and dietary intake indicators. We clearly defined, a priori, the specific outcome measures and metrics that we included in our review.\t \tStudy designs\t11 reviews did not specify which study designs they would include3 reviews included only RCTs1 review included only CCTs1 review included only impact evaluations13 reviews included a variety of study designs, which included \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 2 of: RCTs, BAS, quasi\u00e2\u0080\u0090RCTs, analytical cohort studies, ITS, CCTs, randomised field trials and CSSHowever, the definitions of the study design labels used were not always clear and varied across the included reviews.\tThe study design labels used varied across included reviews and were not always clearly defined.We included both randomised and non\u00e2\u0080\u0090randomised studies, as we expect that existing RCTs in the area of food security would be scarce. We wanted to include the best available evidence for our review question. We clearly defined the type of study designs included in our review.\t \tSearch strategies\tMost reviews ran comprehensive searches. They used a comprehensive set of keywords and searched a variety of relevant databases. Only 5 reviews did not indicate search terms either in the text or in an appendix.2 reviews conducted searches until 201211 reviews searched until 2010\u00e2\u0080\u009320119 reviews searched before 20107 reviews did not specify the date of the last search\tOur review included updated searches across a variety of relevant databases and websites. We drew on common keywords used across these included reviews.\t \tReporting\tThe methods sections of most reviews were often not reported clearly. The reporting of results in these reviews, in terms of characteristics of included studies, was also poor.\tPoor reporting of the characteristics of included studies makes it difficult to assess the context in which these results were obtained. Thus, it is difficult to generalise the results.We clearly reported on the characteristics of included studies, so that the context in which the interventions were implemented was clearly understood.\t \tAMSTAR scores\t9 reviews were of low quality (AMSTAR score: 0\u00e2\u0080\u00934)11 reviews were of moderate quality (AMSTAR score: 5\u00e2\u0080\u00938)8 reviews were of high quality (AMSTAR score: 9\u00e2\u0080\u009311)1 review did not have a score as it did not include any studies\tOf the 8 high\u00e2\u0080\u0090quality reviews, 5 assessed interventions that aimed to improve food availability or utilisation (or both), and 3 assessed interventions addressing food access. The other 2 included reviews that addressed food access were of low quality (AMSTAR = 4).We contributed to the evidence base on interventions addressing food access by producing a high\u00e2\u0080\u0090quality systematic review that assessed the effectiveness of the interventions on relevant outcomes, such as nutritional status.

NR but based on Table 1 reporting baseline data for fewer number of participants than randomised we assume that missing data were excluded.Randomisation ratio: 1:1:1:1:1 (village\u00e2\u0080\u0090level randomisation)Recruitment method: NRSample size justification and outcome used: sample size calculations undertaken to assess the number of clusters (villages) and HHs needed to detect changes in both HH\u00e2\u0080\u0090 and child\u00e2\u0080\u0090level outcomes. Using data from an earlier study in Bangladesh (Ahmed et al. 2010), setting significance level at 0.05 and statistical power at 0.80, assuming attrition of 10% over duration of intervention, and using outcome\u00e2\u0080\u0090specific means, SDs and intracluster correlations, a sample based on 50 clusters per treatment and 10 HHs per cluster would provide sufficient statistical power to detect an increase of: 12% in HH per capita total expenditure per month; 7% in HH per capita calorie intake per day; 16% in child HAZ; and 8% in dietary diversity of children aged 12\u00e2\u0080\u009360 months.Sampling method: same process followed for each region \u00e2\u0080\u0093 North and South: in North, 5 upazilas (subdistricts) were selected using simple random sampling from a list of upazilas where in 2010 the proportion of HHs living below Bangladesh's lower poverty line was \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 25%. All villages within these 5 upazilas were listed. Villages classified as urban or with < 125 HHs were dropped. Using a random number generator, each village was assigned a random number. Villages were then sorted in ascending numerical order with the first 275 retained. Given that in each region, there were 4 treatment groups and a control group, the first 50 villages were assigned to treatment group 1, the second 50 to treatment group 2, the third 50 villages to treatment group 3, the fourth 50 villages to treatment group 4 and the fifth 50 villages to the control group. The remaining 25 villages were held as a reserve. A complete village census was carried out in each of the 250 selected villages, collecting information on HH demographics, a set of poverty indicators, and whether HHs participated in safety nets and other targeted interventions. Using these data, a list was compiled of HHs that: 1. were considered poor (i.e. based on the poverty indicators collected, they were estimated to have consumption below Bangladesh's lower poverty line); 2. would have \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 1 child aged 0\u00e2\u0080\u009324 months when the intervention began; and 3. were not receiving benefits from other safety net interventions. These HHs were eligible to participate in the study. Using simple random sampling, 10 eligible HHs were selected from each village. The total sample in the North included 250 clusters and 2500 HHs. An identical process was used in the South to select upazilas, villages and HHs.Study aim or objective: to devise and implement 2 \u00c3\u0097 2\u00e2\u0080\u0090year RCTs in 2 poor rural areas of Bangladesh with both cash and food treatment groups. Building on the work of Black et al. (2013), the intervention also included 2 treatment groups that aimed to improve maternal knowledge and practices surrounding infant and young child nutrition \u00e2\u0080\u0093 through BCC \u00e2\u0080\u0093 thus making those treatment groups nutrition\u00e2\u0080\u0090sensitive. We designed survey instruments to capture impacts at the child level, both for the key outcome measure of child anthropometry and for individual\u00e2\u0080\u0090level mechanisms that plausibly underlie programme impacts. Using the RCT design, they estimated impacts of each treatment on child height\u00e2\u0080\u0090for\u00e2\u0080\u0090age. In the other paper, the authors assessed its implications for economic outcomes.Study period: 24 months: baseline survey was carried out in March\u00e2\u0080\u0093April 2012, the endline survey was conducted in April 2014.Unit of allocation or exposure: villages\t \tParticipants\tBaseline characteristicsCash onlyAge: child: months (mean): North: 13.1 (SD 6.8), South: 13.8 (SD 6.1); mothers: years (mean): North: 26.5 (SD 5.8), South: 27.1 (SD 5.9)Place of residence: rural areaSex, %: female: 47.4 (50.0)Ethnicity and language: NROccupation: NREducation: schooling grades mean: North: 2.9 (SD 3.1), South: 3.5 (SD 3.3).

Mothers who were randomly selected to be in cash treatment groups received monthly payments via mobile money.Duration of intervention period: 24 months, May 2012 to April 2014Frequency: monthly transfers; on second week of each monthNumber of study contacts: 3: baseline (2012), midline (2013), endline (2014)Providers: programme designed and evaluated by IFPRI and implemented by the United Nations' WFP. WFP managed the procurement and delivery of transfers, as well as the nutrition BCC training, and routinely monitored the programme. An NGO contracted by WFP, the ESDO, was responsible for the field implementation of project activities, including distributing the monthly food and cash transfers, and delivering the nutrition BCC (Ahmed 2019 b)Delivery: delivered using a mobile phone cash transfer system, in which women collected cash from designated distribution sites using mobile verification of identity. To facilitate payments to cash recipients and maintain comparability across groups, a basic mobile phone was provided to target mother in all treatment and control groups.

BCC component that was included in the fourth treatment group in each region consisted of a suite of intensive nutrition BCC activities ('Cash and BCC'). The core activity was a weekly, 1\u00e2\u0080\u0090hour group session in each village with a trained CNW. These sessions covered a defined series of 6 topics: 1. importance of nutrition and diet diversity for health; 2. how handwashing and hygiene improve health; 3. diet diversity and micronutrients; 4. breastfeeding; 5. complementary foods for children aged 6\u00e2\u0080\u009324 months; and 6. maternal nutrition. Several methods were used to deliver this information including presentations, question and answer, interactive call and answer songs and chants, practical demonstrations, and role playing. 1 of these sessions, with only beneficiaries participating, occurred on the day of the transfer distribution. For the remaining group, BCC training each month, other HH members \u00e2\u0080\u0093 particularly mothers\u00e2\u0080\u0090in\u00e2\u0080\u0090law, husbands, and other pregnant or lactating women \u00e2\u0080\u0093 were invited to attend along with beneficiaries, with the intention of creating a supportive HH atmosphere and behaviour change at the HH level. CNWs also made home visits to beneficiaries twice a month to follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up on topics discussed during group sessions and to discuss specific concerns that mothers had.Duration of intervention period: 24 months, May 2012 to April 2014Frequency: monthly transfers; on second week of each month; BCC: main activity was weeklyNumber of study contacts: 3: baseline (2012), midline (2013), endline (2014)Providers: designed and evaluated by the IFPRI and implemented by the United Nations' WFP.

An NGO contracted by WFP, the ESDO, was responsible for the field implementation of project activities, including distributing the monthly food and cash transfers, and delivering the nutrition BCC (Ahmed 2019 b)Delivery: cash delivered using a mobile phone cash transfer system, in which women collected cash from designated distribution sites using mobile verification of identity. While attendance at these BCC sessions was a condition for receipt of transfers, this was a 'soft' condition. When a mother missed a session, the CNW followed up with a home visit to ascertain why the session had been missed, and there were no cases where a beneficiary was dropped from the study for failing to attend sessions. In addition, CNWs staff conducted community meetings and met with influential members (village leaders, imams, elders) of the villages in which the BCC took place to explain the purposes of the nutrition training and to provide them with the information being conveyed to study participants. CNWs received training prior to the start of the intervention. In localities where the same payment point was used for both the cash group and the cash + BCC group, cash beneficiaries were paid in the morning while cash + BCC beneficiaries were paid in the afternoon to minimise the likelihood of information from the BCC activities spilling over to the cash treatment group.

The BCC intervention involved 3 complementary activities: 1. weekly group BCC trainings \u00e2\u0080\u0093 some with beneficiaries only (i.e. the target women in the Food+BCC or Cash+BCC groups) and some that invited other family members to attend along with beneficiaries, 2. twice\u00e2\u0080\u0090a\u00e2\u0080\u0090month visits by CNWs to the beneficiaries' homes, and 3 monthly group meetings between programme staff and influential community leaders.

We note that one might be concerned that BCC could lead to social desirability bias affecting the IYCDDS responses \u00e2\u0080\u0093 i.e. after 2 years of nutrition training, mothers might respond to questions about child feeding by over\u00e2\u0080\u0090reporting foods commonly discussed during the group training sessions. The fact that there were differences between what mothers in the North described and what mothers in the South described \u00e2\u0080\u0093 e.g. that mothers receiving BCC in the South did not report feeding their children dairy products more frequently than those in the control group \u00e2\u0080\u0093 despite their receiving identical BCC gave us some confidence in these results. Ahmed 2019b Study characteristics\t \tMethods\tStudy design: cRCTStudy grouping: parallel groupHow were missing data handled? NR but based on Table 1 reporting baseline data for fewer number of participants than randomised we assume that missing data were excluded.Randomisation ratio: 1:1:1:1:1 (village\u00e2\u0080\u0090level randomisation)Recruitment method: NRSample size justification and outcome used: sample size calculations undertaken to assess the number of clusters (villages) and HHs needed to detect changes in both HH\u00e2\u0080\u0090 and child\u00e2\u0080\u0090level outcomes. Using data from an earlier study in Bangladesh (Ahmed et al. 2010), setting significance level at 0.05 and statistical power at 0.80, assuming attrition of 10% over duration of intervention, and using outcome\u00e2\u0080\u0090specific means, SDs and intracluster correlations, a sample based on 50 clusters per treatment and 10 HHs per cluster would provide sufficient statistical power to detect an increase of: 12% in HH per capita total expenditure per month; 7% in HH per capita calorie intake per day; 16% in child HAZ; and 8% in dietary diversity of children aged 12\u00e2\u0080\u009360 months.Sampling method: same process followed for each region \u00e2\u0080\u0093 North and South: in North, 5 upazilas (subdistricts) were selected using simple random sampling from a list of upazilas where in 2010 the proportion of HHs living below Bangladesh's lower poverty line was \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 25%. All villages within these 5 upazilas were listed. Villages classified as urban or with < 125 HHs were dropped. Using a random number generator, each village was assigned a random number. Villages were then sorted in ascending numerical order with the first 275 retained. Given that in each region, there were 4 treatment groups and a control group, the first 50 villages were assigned to treatment group 1, the second 50 to treatment group 2, the third 50 villages to treatment group 3, the fourth 50 villages to treatment group 4 and the fifth 50 villages to the control group. The remaining 25 villages were held as a reserve. A complete village census was carried out in each of the 250 selected villages, collecting information on HH demographics, a set of poverty indicators, and whether HHs participated in safety nets and other targeted interventions. Using these data, a list was compiled of HHs that: 1. were considered poor (i.e. based on the poverty indicators collected, they were estimated to have consumption below Bangladesh's lower poverty line); 2. would have \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 1 child aged 0\u00e2\u0080\u009324 months when the intervention began; and 3. were not receiving benefits from other safety net interventions. These HHs were eligible to participate in the study. Using simple random sampling, 10 eligible HHs were selected from each village. The total sample in the North included 250 clusters and 2500 HHs. An identical process was used in the South to select upazilas, villages and HHs.Study aim or objective: to devise and implement 2 \u00c3\u0097 2\u00e2\u0080\u0090year RCTs in 2 poor rural areas of Bangladesh with both cash and food treatment groups. Building on the work of Black et al. (2013), the intervention also included 2 treatment groups that aimed to improve maternal knowledge and practices surrounding infant and young child nutrition \u00e2\u0080\u0093 through BCC \u00e2\u0080\u0093 thus making those treatment groups nutrition\u00e2\u0080\u0090sensitive. We designed survey instruments to capture impacts at the child level, both for the key outcome measure of child anthropometry and for individual\u00e2\u0080\u0090level mechanisms that plausibly underlie programme impacts. Using the RCT design, they estimated impacts of each treatment on child height\u00e2\u0080\u0090for\u00e2\u0080\u0090age. In the other paper, the authors assessed its implications for economic outcomes.Study period: 24 months: baseline survey was carried out in March\u00e2\u0080\u0093April 2012, the endline survey was conducted in April 2014.Unit of allocation or exposure: villages\t \tParticipants\tBaseline characteristicsCash onlyAge: child: months (mean): North: 13.1 (SD 6.8), South: 13.8 (SD 6.1); mothers: years (mean): North: 26.5 (SD 5.8), South: 27.1 (SD 5.9)Place of residence: rural areaSex: % female: 54.6 (49.8)Ethnicity and language: NROccupation: NREducation: schooling grades mean: North: 2.9 (SD 3.1), South: 3.5 (SD 3.3).

BCC component that was included in the fourth treatment group in each region consisted of a suite of intensive nutrition BCC activities ('Cash and BCC'). The core activity was a weekly, 1\u00e2\u0080\u0090hour group session in each village with a trained CNW. These sessions covered a defined series of 6 topics: 1. importance of nutrition and diet diversity for health; 2. how handwashing and hygiene improve health; 3. diet diversity and micronutrients; 4. breastfeeding; 5. complementary foods for children aged 6\u00e2\u0080\u009324 months; and 6. maternal nutrition. Several methods were used to deliver this information including presentations, question and answer, interactive call and answer songs and chants, practical demonstrations, and role playing. 1 of these sessions, with only beneficiaries participating, occurred on the day of the transfer distribution. For the remaining group, BCC training each month, other HH members \u00e2\u0080\u0093 particularly mothers\u00e2\u0080\u0090in\u00e2\u0080\u0090law, husbands, and other pregnant or lactating women \u00e2\u0080\u0093 were invited to attend along with beneficiaries, with the intention of creating a supportive HH atmosphere and behaviour change at the HH level. CNWs also made home visits to beneficiaries twice a month to follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up on topics discussed during group sessions and to discuss specific concerns that mothers had.Duration of intervention period: 24 months, May 2012 to April 2014Frequency: monthly transfers; on second week of each month; BCC: main activity was weeklyNumber of study contacts: 3: baseline (2012), midline (2013), endline (2014)Providers: designed and evaluated by the IFPRI and implemented by the United Nations' WFP.

While attendance at these BCC sessions was a condition for receipt of transfers, this was a 'soft' condition. When a mother missed a session, the CNW followed up with a home visit to ascertain why the session had been missed, and there were no cases where a beneficiary was dropped from the study for failing to attend sessions. In addition, CNWs staff conducted community meetings and met with influential members (village leaders, imams, elders) of the villages in which the BCC took place to explain the purposes of the nutrition training and to provide them with the information being conveyed to study participants. CNWs received training prior to the start of the intervention. In localities where the same payment point was used for both the cash group and the cash + BCC group, cash beneficiaries were paid in the morning while cash + BCC beneficiaries were paid in the afternoon to minimise the likelihood of information from the BCC activities spilling over to the cash treatment group.

We noted that 1 might be concerned that BCC could lead to social desirability bias affecting the IYCDDS responses \u00e2\u0080\u0093 i.e. after 2 years of nutrition training, mothers might respond to questions about child feeding by over\u00e2\u0080\u0090reporting foods commonly discussed during the group training sessions. The fact that there are differences between what mothers in the North described and what mothers in the South described \u00e2\u0080\u0093 e.g. that mothers receiving BCC in the South did not report feeding their children dairy products more frequently than those in the control group \u00e2\u0080\u0093 despite their receiving identical BCC gave us some confidence in these results. Alaofe 2016 Study characteristics\t \tMethods\tStudy design: PCSHow were missing data handled? in 2008, enumerators repeated surveys with each woman in the agricultural groups who had been interviewed the year before, if possible. For the village sample, enumerators returned to previously sampled HHs and interviewed the same respondent, wherever possible. If an original respondent was not present and another woman aged > 18 years in the HH could answer the questions, she was interviewed and this was noted. If a respondent's HH could not be found, a neighbouring HH was substituted and this was noted.Randomisation ratio: N/ARecruitment method: HH surveys conducted for each woman in the women's agricultural groups and for a random representative sample of HHs in each village, with women aged > 18 years as respondents. Surveys conducted following installation of the PVDI systems but before any harvest.

The analytic sample was restricted to HHs or mothers with complete data at baseline and endline for a given indicator. Pregnant women at baseline (n = 3) or endline (n = 8) excluded from analyses. ITT protocol used for analysis as 19 SMG WGs at baseline became SMG NWGs at follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up and 2 SMG NWGs became SMG WGs.Randomisation ratio: N/ARecruitment method: villages: before the baseline evaluation, villages in the district of Kalal\u00c3\u00a9 were identified for possible inclusion in the SMG. WG HHs: only 1 mother or carer of childbearing age (15\u00e2\u0080\u009349 years) who had a child aged 6\u00e2\u0080\u009359 months at time of baseline survey (January\u00e2\u0080\u0093March 2014) was invited to participate. NWG HHs: delegates/leaders of the selected villages were contacted to obtain a complete listing of all NWG HHs with a target mother\u00e2\u0080\u0093child. From that list, a single HH was selected as a starting point, using a random number between 1 and the required number of HHs in village.Sample size justification and outcome used: sample size based on available funds with expectation that it would be able to show differences in agricultural production and changes in food security when scaled up from the original pilot study. Sample size was not based on changes in nutritional status.Sampling method: purposive (villages) and random (control HHs): participating villages needed to have potential water sources (as determined by geophysical survey to map groundwater) to support production during dry season. 16 eligible villages identified. Delegates/leaders of selected villages were contacted to obtain a complete listing of all NWG HHs with a target mother\u00e2\u0080\u0093child.

Most common reason was that mothers/carers were working on their land or moved/travelled out of village on day of data collection. In addition, some blood samples were unsuitable for further processing: 5.74% due to haemolysis, 0.47% were specimens without proper requisition slips and 3.23% had insufficient sample quantity.Description of subgroups measured and reported: intervention villages: WG: HHs with women who participated in a local women's agricultural group and NWG: HHs where none of the women belonged to a women's agricultural group.

NR (only available survey data used)Randomisation ratio: N/ARecruitment method: ration cards issued to individuals or families based on their poverty status, and purchased from the PDS. In Odisha state, the KBK region, comprising 8 districts, has universal PDS access; whereas it was a targeted programme in the 22 non\u00e2\u0080\u0090KBK districts.Sample size justification and outcome used: no sample size calculation. National\u00e2\u0080\u0090level surveys carried out to be nationally representative of consumer expenditure; conducted by the National Sample Survey Organization.Sampling method: purposive programme placement by government as the decision to make PDS a universal programme in the KBK region based upon its history of poor nutritional outcome. Hence, the selection of districts into the programme was not random. Sample was restricted to rural areas of Odisha since the PDS revival was more effective in rural areas. KBK region \u00e2\u0080\u0093 with a universal PDS \u00e2\u0080\u0093 was the treatment group while the rest of Odisha was the control group. Non\u00e2\u0080\u0090KBK districts within the same states were control group. For further robustness checks, samples restricted to the KBK districts and considered HHs without any ration card as the alternative control group, with all other HHs with a ration card (AAY/BPL/APL) as the treatment group.Study aim or objective: to determine the role of consumer food subsidies in improving nutritional intake and diet quality by evaluating the expansion of the government food assistance programme coverage in the hunger prone state of Odisha in India.Study period: about 8 years. 2004\u00e2\u0080\u00932005 survey was baseline and the 2011\u00e2\u0080\u00932012 survey was postintervention informationUnit of allocation or exposure: cluster: districts 8 KBK districts with universal PDS (treatment) vs 22 non\u00e2\u0080\u0090KBK districts (control).

Hence, the selection of districts into the program (here, PDS) is not random. We do a slew of robustness check to ensure that we control for this later in the paper.\" \"Results from the DID regressions are presented in Table 6. Estimates as reported in column (1) were arrived at by controlling for the district fixed effects but not for the HH characteristics. In the column (2), both district fixed effects and the HH characteristics were controlled for.\"\t \tBaseline outcome measurements similar (Selection bias)\tLow risk\tOutcome variables related to macronutrient intake and sources of calories were all significantly higher in the control group: calories; protein; fat as well as calories from cereals; non\u00e2\u0080\u0090cereals; pulses; egg, fish and meat; dairy products; vegetables and fruits and edible oil all P < 0.01. However, PSM was performed to account for the non\u00e2\u0080\u0090random allocation of the intervention and control: there were no significant group differences for the covariates used to perform the PSM.\t \tBlinding of participants and personnel (Performance bias)\tLow risk\tParticipants were not blinded to allocation as their subsidy status was determined by their residential district; however, it is unlikely that they would have known that the national survey (from which the data were obtained) would be comparing their nutritional intake with participants receiving another intervention. Implementation of the project by local state government seems totally separate from implementation of the surveys by the respective organisation.\t \tBlinding of outcome assessment (Detection bias)\tHigh risk\tIt is NR whether outcomes were assessed blindly. Outcomes were assessed by self\u00e2\u0080\u0090reported measures.\t \tProtection against contamination (Performance bias)\tLow risk\tAs intervention and control treatments were government\u00e2\u0080\u0090assigned according to state district, it is unlikely that meaningful contamination could have occurred. Any small spillover effect at the border between the 2 areas would be diluted by the large sample sizes and geographical area. NR, but although it is controlled who could and could not buy the rice (ration card), it did not control who actually used it.\t \tIncomplete outcome data (Attrition bias)\tHigh risk\tVery little information provided about attrition, but 3819 HHs were surveyed at baseline and 2973 at follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up, indicating a 87.8% 'response rate'. According to the supplementary data sheet, difference\u00e2\u0080\u0090in\u00e2\u0080\u0090difference estimates were performed on 6722 observations; roughly the sum of available baseline and follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up data. Therefore, it would appear that missing values were not adjusted for or imputed.\t \tSelective outcome reporting (Reporting bias)\tUnclear risk\tNo protocol available and the paper did not follow the usual journal format with a designated Methods section. The aim of the study was to assess unspecified 'nutrient intake indicators' as well as a variety of food items in the diet, according to 6 groups. The latter have all been reported on.\t \tOther bias\tLow risk\tSelection bias was overcome by correction for HH variables. Since we were testing for the significance of a large number of dependent variables, it might lead to higher probability of Type I errors leading to false rejection of the null hypothesis. To control for this bias, we used the summary indices approach of Clingingsmith et al. (2009) and Kling et al. (2004).

Intervention group had fewer cash savings, poorer HH conditions, faced more food deficit, had a smaller number of assets, was more likely to be female headed and had fewer years of education of HH head. Male members from intervention HHs were also less likely be in non\u00e2\u0080\u0090farm self\u00e2\u0080\u0090employment, and more likely to be day labourers.

For the HH spending study, a further 45 HHs were excluded due to very large values for total adjusted expenditure as well as missing values (The Kenya CT\u00e2\u0080\u0090OVC team 2012).Randomisation ratio: 1:1Recruitment method: NRSample size justification and outcome used: NRSampling method: within 7 districts, 4 locations (clusters) were selected randomly after excluding those with particularly low poverty rates or an inadequate capacity to supply the relevant health and education services, or large existing orphans and vulnerable children support programmes. List of eligible HHs was compiled in the intervention locations according to standard programme operation guidelines. In control districts, programme targeting was 'simulated' in order to identify a sample of HHs that were comparable to eligible HHs in intervention areas.Study aim or objective: 1. to determine if the Kenya CT\u00e2\u0080\u0090OVC led to an increase in investment in agricultural and non\u00e2\u0080\u0090agricultural productive assets and activities; increased food consumption obtained from own production; resulted in a shift in adult labour towards own agricultural and non\u00e2\u0080\u0090agricultural activities and away from casual labour; resulted in heterogeneous impact by gender; and reduced the time children spend at work. 2. to investigate whether the CT\u00e2\u0080\u0090OVC had changed the preferences of HHs in terms of their consumption behaviour.Study period: 4 years (March\u00e2\u0080\u0093August 2007 to May\u00e2\u0080\u0093July 2011)Unit of allocation or exposure: location within eligible district\t \tParticipants\tBaseline characteristicsOverall (n = 1783)Age: head of HH (years): 55.97Place of residence: NRSex: proportion female\u00e2\u0080\u0090headed HHs: 0.64Ethnicity and language: Swahili, Luo and SomaliOccupation: salaried employment: 0.04; casual labour: 0.57; self\u00e2\u0080\u0090employed: 0.32Education (years): HH head: 3.37; spouse: 1.25SES: HH size: 5.62; proportion of elderly headed HHs: 0.42; number of orphaned or vulnerable children in the HH: 2.47; total cultivable land: 1.95 hectares; proportion of livestock owners: 0.76; HH expenditure per capita per month (n = 1783): KES 1285.98Social capital: NRNutritional status: NRMorbidities: proportion of HHs where head of HH was ill: 0.02Concomitant or previous care: NRIntervention or exposure group (n = 1265)Age: HH head (years): 58.53; number of HH members aged < 11 years: 1.97; number of HH members aged 12\u00e2\u0080\u009317 years: 1.31Place of residence: proportion of communities far away from local market: 0.21Sex: proportion female\u00e2\u0080\u0090headed HHs: 0.65Ethnicity and language: Swahili, Luo and SomaliOccupation: proportion of individuals unemployed 0.64, in wage labour 0.01, casual work 0.09, off farm work 0.03Education (years): HH head: 2.99; spouse: 1.10SES: AE total expenditure: KES 1441.89; AE monthly housing expenditure: KES 34.51; share of total expenditure spent on housing: 0.025; HH size: 5.55; proportion of HHs with transfers as main income: 0.07; monthly HH consumption (per capita): KES 1298.09; total cultivable land: 1.70 hectares; proportion of livestock owners (n = 1265): 0.75Social capital: NRNutritional status: AE monthly expenditure per food group (KES): cereals 266.23, tubers 53.06, meat fish 119.28, dairy 47.68, fruit vegetables 186.04, other food 167.42, eating out 9.32; HDDS 7\u00e2\u0080\u0090day: 5.225; proportion of children aged < 5 years who were: stunted 0.415, underweight 0.206, wasted 0.06.

Intervention HHs were also less likely to use unprotected water sources, have various HH assets, but more HHs in which agriculture was the main source of income and less in which salaried employment was the main source of income. Intervention communities had more access to a road to the village and less distance to the local market, but a lower share of HHs which could make telephone calls. Intervention individuals were significantly older and more likely to be disabled, unemployed or in casual work; and had lower levels of education. For the HH spending paper (Kenya CT\u00e2\u0080\u0090OVC 2012): intervention HHs expended significantly more of their monthly budget on tubers.Attrition per relevant group: at 24 months (Asfaw 2014): intervention group: 231/1542 (15%); control group: 184/571 (24.4%).

Of this, KES 383.3 million was spent on HHs; with the balance spent on operational costs, but administrative costs are said to be declining proportionally each year. In 2010, the cost of supporting a single HH for a year was KES 36,978 (transfer included).Control: no intervention\t \tOutcomes\tProportion of HH expenditure on food: total monthly consumption expenditure (per AE); proportion of HH monthly consumption expenditure on food; total monthly food expenditure (cereals, tubers, meat/fish, dairy, fruit/vegetables, other food, food eaten out)Dietary diversity: DDS; proportion of HHs that consumed individual food groups (e.g. cereal, fruit, etc.) in the preceding 7 daysAnthropometry: HAZ; WAZ; WHZ; stunting; underweight; wastingMorbidity: number of children with reported symptoms of upper respiratory illness\t \tIdentification\tSponsorship source: UK DfID; US National Institute of Mental Health; Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and DevelopmentCountry: KenyaSetting: ultra\u00e2\u0080\u0090poor HHs in rural areas with high prevalence of HIV/AIDSAuthors' names: Solomon Asfaw; Tia Palermo; Patrick WardEmail: solomon.asfaw@fao.org; tiampalermo@gmail.com; patrick.ward@opml.co.ukDeclarations of interest: noStudy or programme name and acronym: Kenya CT\u00e2\u0080\u0090OVC (Cash Transfer Programme for Orphans and Vulnerable Children)Type of record: journal articles, operational and impact evaluation reportTrial registration: none reportedProtocol availability: no\t \tNotes\tPopulation: AE: children aged < 15 years were considered as 0.75 of an adult; children aged \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 15 years were considered a full adult.\t \tRisk of bias\t \tBias\tAuthors' judgement\tSupport for judgement\t \tRandom sequence generation (Selection bias)\tUnclear risk\tAuthors mentioned random selection of intervention and control locations within 7 districts, but did not report how the random sequence was generated.\t \tAllocation concealment (Selection bias)\tUnclear risk\tNo information provided on how the locations within districts were randomised; or how this randomisation sequence was protected.\t \tBaseline characteristics similar (Selection bias)\tLow risk\tBaseline differences reported between groups.

Intervention HHs also had significantly fewer assets (99% CI). The proportion of control HHs that had agriculture as the main source of income was significantly lower (90% CI). The 24\u00e2\u0080\u0090month analyses adjusted for baseline HH demographic composition (Kenya CT\u00e2\u0080\u0090OVC team 2012), whereas the analysis after 4 years used estimated propensity scores to account for these baseline differences (Asfaw 2014).\t \tBaseline outcome measurements similar (Selection bias)\tLow risk\tNo baseline non\u00e2\u0080\u0090equivalence was detected for the HH spending (Kenya CT\u00e2\u0080\u0090OVC 2012) paper; with the exception of proportion AE monthly expenditure for tubers which was significantly higher in the intervention group (P = 0.005). Outcomes such as HH expenditure on food and proportion of children with underweight or stunting, or both (< \u00e2\u0080\u00932SD z\u00e2\u0080\u0090scores) were similar between the groups. There was no baseline non\u00e2\u0080\u0090equivalence for the HH spending paper; with the exception of proportion AE monthly expenditure for tubers, which was significantly higher in the intervention group (P = 0.005).

Clusters were assigned before recruitment of HHs; which may have lead to a bias in participation, especially for control HHs. Other bias: the introduction of punitive conditionalities in some intervention clusters, but not others, may have lead to bias in attrition or bias in outcome measurement.

At these meetings, the programme beneficiary and her parents/guardians were offered the monthly transfer amounts. This consisted of a transfer to the parents, a transfer directly to the girl and payment of school fees for girls attending secondary school. Transfer amounts to parents were varied randomly across EAs at USD 4, USD 6, USD 8 and USD 10 per month, so that each parent within an EA received the same offer. Within each EA, there was a lottery to determine the transfer amount to the programme beneficiaries, which was USD 1, USD 2, USD 3, USD 4 or USD 5 per month. The lottery was held publicly to ensure that the process was transparent. Secondary school fees were paid in full directly to schools.Sample size justification and outcome used: NRSampling method: stratified random sampling. Zomba district contains 550 EAs (Zomba city 50; rural traditional authorities 500). 176 EAs were selected from 3 different geographical strata: urban (Zomba city, 29 EAs), near rural (16 km from Zomba city, 119 EAs) and far rural (\u00e2\u0089\u00a5 16 km from Zomba city, 28 EAs). Of the 50 EAs in Zomba city, 21 were excluded on the basis of advice from local experts who deemed these areas too affluent for the proposed intervention. In each of the 2 rural strata, with the exception of 1 TA that was unsafe for field work, the study EAs were randomly selected. In the 176 sampled EAs, each dwelling was visited to take a census of all never\u00e2\u0080\u0090married girls aged 13\u00e2\u0080\u009322 years (sample frame). Girls were grouped according to those enrolled in school at baseline (baseline schoolgirls), or those not enrolled in school at baseline (baseline dropouts). In the cohort of baseline schoolgirls, a subset of eligible girls was randomly selected for the study. The sampling percentages for this cohort differed by geographical stratum and age group and was 14\u00e2\u0080\u009345% in urban areas and 70\u00e2\u0080\u0093100% in rural areas. All the girls who were not enrolled in school at baseline (baseline dropouts) were sampled to participate in the study This sampling procedure yielded a baseline study sample of 4051 girls of whom 3796 (94%) were enrolled and completed a baseline interview at the end of 2007. Of these, 889 were baseline dropouts and 2907 were baseline schoolgirls.Study aim or objective: to examine whether a cash transfer programme targeted at adolescent girls in Malawi helped empower its recipients in the short\u00e2\u0080\u0090run, i.e. during and immediately after the 2\u00e2\u0080\u0090year intervention.Study period: 2007\u00e2\u0080\u00932012Unit of allocation or exposure: females aged 13\u00e2\u0080\u009322 years\t \tParticipants\tBaseline characteristicsOverall group (n = 2706): NRIntervention or exposure group (n = 1211)Age (years): baseline school girls, means: CCT group 14.9 (SD 1.8); UCT group 15.4 (SD 1.9); girls not attending school at baseline: 16.8 (SD 2.4)Place of residence: urban HH, means: baseline school girls: CCT group 0.478 (SD 0.5); UCT group 0.418 (SD 0.494); girls not attending school at baseline: 0.129 (SD 0.335)Sex: female\u00e2\u0080\u0090headed HH: baseline school girls, n (%): CCT group 63 (26); UCT group 78 (24); girls not attending school at baseline, n (%): 90 (39)Ethnicity and language: NROccupation: N/AEducation: highest grade attended: baseline school girls, means: CCT group 7.1 (SD 1.7); UCT group 7.9 (SD 1.6); girls not attending school at baseline, means: 5.8 (SD 2.9)SES: HH size: baseline school girls, means: CCT group 6.341 (SD 2.1); UCT group 6.7 (SD 2.1); Girls not attending school at baseline, means: 6.1 (SD 2.6); electricity in dwelling: baseline school girls, n (%): CCT group 31 (28); UCT group 49 (24); girls not attending school at baseline, n (%): 24 (11); piped water in dwelling: baseline school girls, n (%): CCT group 48 (41); UCT group 135 (60); Girls not attending school at baseline, n (%): 63 (25)Social capital: NRNutritional status: NRMorbidities: NRConcomitant or previous care: NRControl group (n = 1495)Age: years: Baseline school girls, means: 15.3 (SD 1.9); girls not attending school at baseline: 17.6 (SD 2.2)Place of residence: urban HH, means: Baseline school girls: 0.35 (SD 0.48); girls not attending school at baseline: 0.18 (SD 0.39)Sex: female\u00e2\u0080\u0090headed HH: baseline school girls, n (%): 275 (32); girls not attending school at baseline, n (%): 93 (42)Ethnicity and language: NROccupation: N/AEducation: highest grade attended: baseline school girls, means: 7.6 (SD 1.6); girls not attending school at baseline, means: 6.2 (SD 2.9)SES: HH size: baseline school girls, means: 6.375 (SD 2.262); girls not attending school at baseline, means: 6.12 (SD 2.388); electricity in dwelling: baseline school girls, n (%): 86 (20); girls not attending school at baseline, n (%): 16 (7); piped water in dwelling: Baseline school girls, n (%): 277 (47); girls not attending school at baseline, n (%): 64 (29)Social capital: NRNutritional status: NRMorbidities: NRConcomitant or previous care: NRInclusion criteria: never\u00e2\u0080\u0090married girls aged 13\u00e2\u0080\u009322 years enrolled in school at baseline (baseline schoolgirls), and those not enrolled in school at baseline (baseline dropouts) in selected 176 EAs.Exclusion criteria: NRBaseline imbalance: in the girls who attended school at baseline, those in the CCT group were younger than those in the UCT group, and, therefore, also a lower grade attained.Attrition per relevant group: reported at postintervention follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up (2 years after intervention): baseline school girls: control group: 10.7%; intervention group: NR.

NRRandomisation ratio: 1:1:1:1:1 (according to table 1)Recruitment method: village headmen together with the village committees select HHs to participate. Specific recruitment methods NRSample size justification and outcome used: NRSampling method: sampling for the trial: of 28 districts with the PWP programme, 12 districts randomly sampled, stratified by geographic region. Of these 12 districts, 182 villages (EAs) that had been sampled for the national survey in 2010\u00e2\u0080\u00932011 AND preselected for PWP were selected. These were then randomised to the treatment groups. Villages in the sampling frame were randomly assigned to 1 of 5 groups. Group 0 was control group of villages that were not included in PWP programme in 2012\u00e2\u0080\u00932013 Season. Groups 1\u00e2\u0080\u00934 participated in the PWP in the planting season (cycle 1 of PWP). These 4 groups varied in terms of timing of the second cycle of programme and the schedule of payments in both cycles. At HH level: they choose 10 HHs from the 16 survey HHs in the village to be offered the programme. Sampling for MSFA programme covered all districts of Malawi through a 2\u00e2\u0080\u0090stage targeting approach. In the first stage, there was pro\u00e2\u0080\u0090poor geographic targeting and in the second there was a combination of community\u00e2\u0080\u0090based targeting and self\u00e2\u0080\u0090selection of beneficiaries. The amount of funds given to a district was proportional to the district's population and to the poverty rates as well as other measures of vulnerability. District officials then targeted a subset of EPAs based on poverty and vulnerability criteria. Traditional authorities in the EPAs then allocated funds to a subset of selected GVH who each oversaw 3\u00e2\u0080\u009310 villages. The GVH determined how many HHs participated in each village based on available funding; the GVH then worked with the village committees in each village to select participating HHs.Study aim or objective: to determine the impact of these programmes by estimating the effect of Malawi's large\u00e2\u0080\u0090scale PWP, which operates under the MSAF to improve food security and increase the use of fertiliser and other agricultural inputs. The MASAF PWP has been operational since mid\u00e2\u0080\u00901990s and aimed to provide short\u00e2\u0080\u0090term labour\u00e2\u0080\u0090intensive activities to poor, able\u00e2\u0080\u0090bodied HHs for the purpose of enhancing their food security, mainly through increased access to farm inputs during the planting period. Programme was designed to be interlinked with Malawi's large\u00e2\u0080\u0090scale FISP through the implementation of the PWP in the planting months of the main agricultural season when the FISP distribution also occurs. The premise behind this is that the PWP facilitates poor, credit\u00e2\u0080\u0090constrained HHs to access subsidised fertiliser.Study period: baseline: 2010\u00e2\u0080\u00932011 (based on data collected during the national integrated HH survey.

For the former, analyses are based on round 1 of data collection, when interventions had not started in all but 3 villages but knowledge of PWP implementation existed and could have influenced behaviour. For the latter, they explored the balance between treatment and control villages in terms of pretreatment covariates and outcomes, they used the IHS3 data from 2010\u00e2\u0080\u00932011. Using the first round of follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up data, they found that HHs in the non\u00e2\u0080\u0090IHS3 sample were better off than the IHS3 sample, with better educated HH heads, smaller HH sizes and fewer children aged < 14. However, there was imbalance in preprogramme food security at both the village and HH levels in the 159 villages for which IHS3 data were available. The IHS sample was well balanced for a range of non food\u00e2\u0080\u0090security outcomes.Attrition per relevant group: NRDescription of subgroups measured and reported: effects by geographic regionTotal number completed and analysed per relevant group: NR: only total number of observations reported.Total number enrolled per relevant group: 10 HHs in each village offered the programmeTotal number randomised per relevant group: group 0 (control): 38 communities; group 1 (cycle 1: planting season, cycle 2: harvest season; lump sum): 40 communities; group 2 (cycle 1: planting season, cycle 2: harvest season; split payment): 34 communities; group 3 (cycle 1: planting season, cycle 2: lean season; lump sum): 35 communities; group 4 (cycle 1: planting season, cycle 2: lean season; split payment): 35 communities.\t \tInterventions\tIntervention characteristicsIntervention or exposureFood access intervention category: income generationIntervention type: PWPDescription: MASAF PWP has been operational since mid\u00e2\u0080\u00901990s and aims to provide short\u00e2\u0080\u0090term labour\u00e2\u0080\u0090intensive activities to poor, able\u00e2\u0080\u0090bodied HHs for the purpose of enhancing their food security, mainly through increased access to farm inputs during planting period. Programme was designed to be interlinked with Malawi's FISP through implementation of PWP in planting months of the main agricultural season when the FISP distribution also occurs. The premise was that the PWP facilitates poor, credit\u00e2\u0080\u0090constrained HHs to access subsidised fertiliser. Projects were mostly road rehabilitation or construction, with some forestation and irrigation projects. Wage rate was MWK 300/day (USD 0.92/day) for a total payment of MWK 3600 for a 12\u00e2\u0080\u0090day wave. Cycle 1 of PWP was implemented during planting season (October\u00e2\u0080\u0093December) to align with the timing of the distribution of FISP. Cycle 2 of PWP was designed to take place after harvest in June and July.Duration of intervention period: November\u00e2\u0080\u0093December 2012 to November 2013 (1 year)Frequency: group 1: 4 payments in total (2 in cycle 1, 2 in cycle 2). Group 3: similar to group 1 only timing was different. Group 2 and 4: each payment in cycle 2 was split into 5 payments (so 12 payments in total). In 2012, as a response to a large currency devaluation, the programme was doubled in size and scaled up to cover about 500,000 HHs per year. Duration of project participation increased from 12 days to 48 days, split into 2 cycles of 24 days each; the cycles were further divided into 2 consecutive 12\u00e2\u0080\u0090day waves, and payments were generally made within 1 or 2 weeks of the end of each wave.\"Number of study contacts: data came from 5 rounds of panel HH survey data. Basis for panel was the IHS3 fielded in 2010\u00e2\u0080\u00932011 by Malawi's National Statistics Office. The 16 IHS3 HHs were interviewed in 4 additional rounds: before the public works projects started during planting season (November 2012) after the first cycle, preharvest (February 2013), after the lean season cycle, postharvest (April\u00e2\u0080\u0093May 2013) and finally after the completion of the 2012\u00e2\u0080\u00932013 season (November 2013).Providers: MASAF PWP is a government programme but the study was implemented by research team. Payments in the study districts were facilitated by the research team for the purposes of the evaluation. This was intended to ensure that payments were made without delay, on specific schedules. Administrative payment records confirmed that there were no differences in time lag between work and payment across the districts.Delivery: groups 1\u00e2\u0080\u00934 participated in the PWP in the planting season (cycle 1 of PWP). These 4 groups varied in terms of timing of the second cycle of the programme and the schedule of payments in both cycles. However, the analysis grouped all these intervention groups into 1 to assess overall effect of having a PWP programme in place. Payments in the study districts were facilitated by the research team for the evaluation. This was intended to ensure that payments were made without delay, on specific schedules. Administrative payment records confirmed that there were no differences in time lag between work and payment across the districts. In addition to the HH survey data, in terms of monitoring the intervention, administrative records included the dates and amounts of payments and the identities of recipients. These were used to confirm that beneficiaries received payments in accordance with the days they worked. Payments in the study districts were facilitated by the research team for the purposes of the evaluation, with physical delivery of the cash in conjunction with the district officials. The split\u00e2\u0080\u0090payment variant slightly increased the cost of implementation. Epayments, which would entail a small marginal cost of delivery, were under consideration for future rounds of PWP.Co\u00e2\u0080\u0090interventions: in 3 study districts, fertiliser subsidy coupon distribution took place between the first and second 12\u00e2\u0080\u0090day waves of PWP activities, and, in the remaining 9 districts, fertiliser coupon distribution overlapped with PWP work and payment. The national fertiliser subsidy programme provided about half of HHs in the country with coupons that allowed 2 bags of fertiliser to be purchased for MWK 500 each. However, fertiliser coupons were more likely to be available to treated HHs in accordance with the designed linkage between PWP and the national fertiliser subsidy scheme.Resource requirements: NREconomic indicators: wage rate was MWK 300/day (USD 0.92/day) for a total payment of MWK 3600 for a 12\u00e2\u0080\u0090day wave.

Breisinger 2018 Study characteristics\t \tMethods\tStudy design: controlled trial (using regression discontinuity for allocation)How were missing data handled? It is assumed that missing data were excluded. The intended sample for the Takaful and Karama analysis components consisted of 7996 HHs. Of these, 1144 HHs could not be located based on the address data in the registration form. An additional 261 HHs were visited but no HH members could be located, and 70 HHs were not surveyed due to other reasons including declining to participate in the survey, no capable respondent being identified, being part of another HH already in the sample or the registrant having died. Considering only HHs for which there was no error in the location information, the overall response rate was 95.2%.Randomisation ratio: N/ARecruitment method: see sampling methodology. Sampled HHs were visited by an interviewer.Sample size justification and outcome used: outcome used NR. Justification: based on power calculations that the evaluation team conducted to determine the sample size required for the TKP impact evaluation, the study required 8016 HHs spread across 501 clusters (villages), with 16 HHs per cluster. Authors purposefully selected more than the 16 HHs per cluster knowing that there was a risk of being unable to locate all the HHs in the registrant sample.Sampling method: targeting for programme: to avoid inefficient targeting, the programme combined geographical targeting with a PMT mechanism. With respect to the geographical targeting, the programme was first launched in the poorest districts within the poorest governorates in Egypt. The PMT was used to identify the poor within the selected districts, based on selection criteria and a set cutoff score, based on the poverty line derived from Egypt's HH Income, Expenditure and Consumption Survey for 2012\u00e2\u0080\u00932013. In addition to the PMT, both Takaful and Karama have other categorical selection criteria; Takaful requires that beneficiaries have children and Karama requires that beneficiaries be elderly or disabled (or both), or (added later) orphaned. PMT formula varies by region but the threshold is the same across all regions. Over time, since the programme started and across the 4 enrolment waves, the threshold has been changed. Sampling for the impact evaluation survey: \"The sampling strategy for the TKP Impact evaluation was designed to provide a representative sample of Takaful and Karama HHs with Proxy Means Test scores near the thresholds for an RD [regression discontinuity] approach to impact analysis. Stratification for the sample selection was based primarily on region. For the Upper Rural region of Egypt, they stratified by governorate (9 governorates in Upper Rural). As such, they defined 14 strata: 5 for each region excluding Upper Rural and 9 strata for Upper Rural. They sampled VCs within the 14 region\u00e2\u0080\u0090governorate strata using simple random sampling, where the number of clusters per stratum was proportional to the share of registrants in each stratum, and restricted selection to clusters in which there was a sufficient number of registrants near the threshold. The clusters were defined as Takaful\u00e2\u0080\u0090only clusters (325) or mixed Takaful and Karama clusters (75). Within each village, 20 HHs were randomly selected for inclusion in the survey if they were within 600 points of the current Takaful threshold score of 4500 or 200 points of the Karama threshold of 7203. On average, they selected 10 eligible and 10 ineligible HHs, and for Takaful HHs, they weighted the probability of selection such that HHs within 200 points of the current threshold of 4500 were 2.5 times more likely, and HHs within 200\u00e2\u0080\u0093400 points of the cutoff were 1.5 times more likely to be selected than those that were 400\u00e2\u0080\u0093600 points from the cutoff. They selected more HHs than the 16 HHs per cluster that the power calculations suggested would be necessary, knowing that there was a risk of not being able to locate all the HHs in the registrant sample.Study aim or objective: objective of programme: Takaful and Karama is a conditional 5 cash transfer programme that seeks to provide income support to poor families with children (under 18 years of age), poor elderly (aged \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 65 years) and people with severe disability. Objective of impact evaluation: to provide rigorous evidence on the impacts of the programme on HH consumption, poverty and other measures of well\u00e2\u0080\u0090being including child education, health and food security, and the prevalence of overweight and obesity in adult women.Study period: approximately 28 months. Programme start: March 2015; impact evaluation survey: 15 July to 30 August 2017. Takaful beneficiaries were in programme for about 11 months on average.Unit of allocation or exposure: HHs\t \tParticipants\tBaseline characteristicsIntervention or exposure: NRControl: NROverall: NRInclusion criteria: 1. Eligible governorates: those where the share of Takaful\u00e2\u0080\u0090eligible HHs (HH eligibility defined as having a PMT score \u00e2\u0089\u00a4 4500) in the governorate was \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 0.5%. Therefore, governorates that had a very small share of eligible HHs in TKP were excluded, in part to help manage survey costs. The only exception was governorates in the Frontier region, where the share of eligible HHs was < 0.5%. These governorates were kept so that the Frontier region, which may have had different sources of poverty and food insecurity, was represented in the evaluation sample. 2. Eligible VCs for Takaful: those that had \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 7 Takaful eligible HHs. 3. Eligible VCs for Karama: those that had \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 6 Karama eligible HHs with a PMT score 7000\u00e2\u0080\u00937400 and had \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 1 elderly (aged \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 65 years) or disabled member.Exclusion criteria: PMT\u00e2\u0080\u0090score\u00e2\u0080\u0090based targeting, if they met 1 of 6 exclusion criteria: owned a car, owned > 1 feddan of land, had a government job or pension, received transfers from abroad or had a formal private sector job with insurance. No children.Pretreatment: Tables A2.1\u00e2\u0080\u0093A2.6 showed that of 20 HH characteristics all but 1 showed a statistically significant difference for beneficiaries vs non\u00e2\u0080\u0090beneficiaries. Therefore, the HHs on either side of the cutoff were similar and provided valid comparison groups. There were NO baseline data \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the above related to (quote): \"Finally, we check whether adding some HH characteristics to the specifications affects our impact estimates. Rather than include all of the variables in the PMT score (which would be endogenous and also highly correlated with the PMT score, which is a requirement for inclusion in the generalised IV and RD models), we include a subset of potentially exogenous HH characteristics (such as HH size, education level of the HH head) as controls in the specification.\"Attrition per relevant group: as there was no baseline and follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up of participants in this study, no attrition was reported.

However, Karama ended up not being evaluated.Description: Takaful (Solidarity) is a family income support scheme, conditioned on school attendance and health outcomes. Cash transfers are conditioned on attendance of \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 85% of the school days by children aged 6\u00e2\u0080\u009318 years, and on conducting 2 visits per year to the health clinics by mothers and children aged < 6 years; in addition to maintaining child growth monitoring records, and attending nutrition awareness sessions. Takaful transfers start from a basic amount of EBP 325 per HH per month, which increases depending on the number of children in the HHs and their educational level. When the programme was first designed, each HH used to receive EBP 60 for each child in primary education, EBP 80 for each child in preparatory education and EBP 100 for each child in secondary education. HHs could receive benefits for up to 3 children. Conditionalities for school attendance and healthcare utilisation had yet to be implemented. Therefore, this was treated as a UCT.Duration of intervention period: beneficiaries had been in programme for about 11 months on average. Maximum period: about 2 years and 4 months (28 months). First payments: March 2015 (but note that many HHs were included more recently).Frequency: from start of programme to end of 2016, transfers were delivered on quarterly basis for Takaful. Starting in 2017, transfers for Takaful were monthly.Number of study contacts: 1; no baseline data. Data for impact evaluation collected at survey conducted in 1.Providers: implemented by the MoSS, and co\u00e2\u0080\u0090financed by the Government of Egypt and the World Bank.Delivery: frequency of transfers changed over time. Some people had to travel to collect the money but this was not identified as a deterrent. The survey data showed that 63% of programme applicants did not face any challenges while applying. HHs that became beneficiaries had more challenges than HHs that did become beneficiaries, which may be because the non\u00e2\u0080\u0090beneficiaries were excluded or gave up early in the application process. Applicants who did not become beneficiaries, however, were more likely (about 8% of applicants) to say that there was insufficient explanation of the process. The programme experience in terms of transfers was also positive. There were almost no reports of problems with the transfers in the survey. About 93% of programme beneficiaries in the sample faced no challenges in receiving the transfers.Co\u00e2\u0080\u0090interventions: none reported.Resource requirements: NREconomic indicators: NRControlNo intervention (registrant HHs just above the PMT Score threshold)\t \tOutcomes\tDietary diversity: HH DDS (0\u00e2\u0080\u009312); mother's DDS; child 6\u00e2\u0080\u0090 to 23\u00e2\u0080\u0090month DDS; child 24\u00e2\u0080\u0090 to 59\u00e2\u0080\u0090month DDSAnthropometry: HAZ; wastedMorbidity: % children aged < 5 years who had diarrhoea in past 4 weeks; % children aged < 5 years who had fever in past 4 weeksAdverse outcomes: overweight\t \tIdentification\tSponsorship source: UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office (UK FCO)Country: EgyptSetting: poor HHs.

The second sampling stage consisted of randomly selecting 14 VCs within the 2 traditional authorities in Mangochi and 15 VCs from Salima for a total of 29 study VCs. The final sampling stage was at the HH level; in Mangochi VCs, where the number of eligible HHs tended to be high, 125 eligible HHs were randomly selected in each of the 14 study VCs.

Brunie 2014 Study characteristics\t \tMethods\tStudy design: PCSStudy grouping: parallel groupHow were missing data handled? attrition between baseline and endline was 10.1% overall. Missing data were excluded from analyses. 38 HHs declared participating in activities that did not correspond to their group \u00e2\u0080\u0093 these observations were excluded from analyses.Randomisation ratio: 2:2:2:2 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 VSL only; VSL + AM; AM only; control; authors mentioned factorial randomised design but it was not really randomised.Recruitment method: districts were randomised to 1 of 2 intervention groups or a control group. Intervention HHs declared interest in participating and the control group comprised sample HHs taken from the general population.Sample size justification and outcome used: sample size was calculated based on approximate estimates from past studies on food sufficiency, HDDS, IDDS and WAZ. These calculations indicated that 20 primary sampling units, comprising 14 HHs, per district was sufficient; resulting in 560(?) HHs per group.Sampling method: 2\u00e2\u0080\u0090stage sampling approach employed. First, 8/18 districts purposefully selected, and each intervention group was allocated 2 districts. Sample of HHs that declared interest in participating in VSL/AM activities was drawn and a sample from general population was drawn for the control group. Then PSUs were selected: in intervention group, PSUs were VSL groups, and in the control group the PSUs were the EAs from the 2007 Census. Second, HHs were selected: eligible HHs within selected PSUs were enumerated and random sample drawn. HH participation was voluntary. PSUs were randomly selected with probability proportionate to size (in terms of number of HHs represented).Study aim or objective: to evaluate the impact of participation in an economic\u00e2\u0080\u0090strengthening initiative, namely VSL groups, on HH and child nutritional outcomes, with an additional focus on identifying possible gaps and areas for complementary programming.Study period: August 2009\u00e2\u0080\u0093August 2012Unit of allocation or exposure: provincial districts allocated to intervention groups\t \tParticipants\tBaseline characteristicsIntervention or exposureAge: mean number of children aged < 5 years: VSL: 0.84 (SE 0.87); VSL + AM: 1.04 (SE 0.87); mean age of HH head, years: VSL 43.19 (SE 14.28); VSL + AM: 38.77 (SE 11.43)Place of residence: NRSex: male\u00e2\u0080\u0090headed HHs, %: VSL: 90.54; VSL + AM: 86.90Ethnicity and language: NROccupation: agriculture primary occupation, %: VSL: 87.72: VSL + AM: 90.18Education: mean education of HH head, years: VSL: 3.28 (SE 3.00); VSL + AM: 3.90 (SE 2.92); mean education of spouse, years: VSL 1.83 (SE 2.04); VSL + AM 2.49 (SE 5.58)SES: mean HH size: VSL 4.70 (SE 2.03); VSL + AM: 5.47 (SE 1.97); annual HH income: VSL: MZM 9398 (SE 18,088); VSL + AM: 11,525 (SE 22,482)Social capital: NRNutritional status: mean months of food sufficiency: VSL: 10.41; VSL + AM: 9.27; mean HDDS: VSL: 4.06; VSL + AM: 4.20; mean IDDS: VSL: 2.51; VSL + AM: 2.99; mean WAZ: VSL: \u00e2\u0080\u00931.21; VSL + AM: \u00e2\u0080\u00930.96Morbidities: NRConcomitant or previous care: SANA (Seguranca Alimentar de Nutricao e Agricultura) \u00e2\u0080\u0093 number NRControlAge: mean number of children aged < 5 years: 0.62 (SE 0.78); mean age of HH head, years: 43.34 (SE 13.93)Place of residence: NRSex: male\u00e2\u0080\u0090headed HHs, %: 90.30Ethnicity and language: NROccupation: agriculture primary occupation, %: 87.55Education: mean education of HH head, years: 3.33 (SE 3.21) years; mean education of spouse, years: 1.44 (SE 1.84)SES: mean annual HH income: MZM 8843 (20,354)Social capital: NRNutritional status: VSL matched mean months of food sufficiency: 10.58; VSL + AM matched mean months of food sufficiency: 10.47; VSL matched mean HDDS: 3.73; VSL + AM matched mean HDDS: 3.82; VSL matched mean IDDS: 2.87; VSL + AM matched mean IDDS: 2.82; VSL matched mean WAZ: \u00e2\u0080\u00931.25; VSL + AM matched mean WAZ: \u00e2\u0080\u00931.15Morbidities: NRConcomitant or previous care: SANA (Seguranca Alimentar de Nutricao e Agricultura) \u00e2\u0080\u0093 number NROverallAge: mean number of children aged < 5 years: 0.84 (SE 0.85); mean age of HH head, years: 41.85 (SE 13.46)Place of residence: NRSex: % male\u00e2\u0080\u0090headed HHs: 89.3Ethnicity and language: NROccupation: agriculture primary occupation, %: 88.43Education: mean education of HH head, years: 3.50 (SE 3.07); mean education of spouse, years: 2.03 (SE 5.18)SES: mean HH size: 4.94 (SE 2.02); mean annual HH income: MZM 9858 (SE 20,412).Social capital: NRNutritional status: NRMorbidities: NRConcomitant or previous care: SANA \u00e2\u0080\u0093 number NRInclusion criteria: HHs expressing interest in participating in the activity their district was randomised to.Exclusion criteria: NR.Pretreatment: NR.

Chen 2019 Study characteristics\t \tMethods\tStudy design: cRCTStudy grouping: parallel groupHow were missing data handled? data from non\u00e2\u0080\u0090boarding students and from boarding students who did not have Hb concentration, height and weight measurements were excluded from the analysis.Randomisation ratio: 1:1:2 (nutrition subsidy intervention:nutrition subsidy + monetary incentive intervention:control)Recruitment method: in each 1 of 30 townships, with the necessary permission from the Chinese government, schools were chosen if they offered fourth and fifth grade classes and accommodated \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 400 students. Once schools were selected, written assent was requested from students and their parents. Written consent was also requested from the students' legal guardians at school (schoolmasters and head teachers).Sample size justification and outcome used: NRSampling method: 30 townships were randomly selected from 2 provincial\u00e2\u0080\u0090level administration units, Qinghai Province and Ningxia Autonomous Region. Schools were selected from these townships and all fourth and fifth graders from these schools with assent and consent were included.Study aim or objective: how does the provision of nutrition subsidies translate into observed nutritional and health outcomes? Will policy targets with different levels of specificity, e.g. general ones such as malnutrition prevention and specific ones such as anaemia reduction, lead to different behavioural responses and, thus, nutritional and health outcomes, partly through different incentives attached to these policy targets (since certain incentives are presumably needed to achieve any specific policy target)?Study period: October 2009\u00e2\u0080\u0093May 2010Unit of allocation or exposure: cluster: elementary schools\t \tParticipants\tBaseline characteristicsNutrition subsidyAge: NRPlace of residence: NRSex: entire group (analysed group): mean proportion of boys: 0.52 (0.49)Ethnicity and language: entire group (analysed group): mean proportion of ethnic\u00e2\u0080\u0090minority students: 0.62 (0.64); mean proportion with migrant father: 0.71 (0.80); mean proportion with migrant mother: 0.11 (0.12)Occupation: NREducation: entire group (analysed group): mean proportion of fifth graders: 0.49 (0.56); mean education of father, years: 6.12 (6.11); mean education of mother, years: 4.32 (4.32); mean proportion of senior\u00e2\u0080\u0090level teaching staff: 0.48 (0.48)SES: entire group (analysed group): mean number of siblings: 2.18 (2.19)Social capital: NRNutritional status: entire group: mean BMI\u00e2\u0080\u0090for\u00e2\u0080\u0090age z\u00e2\u0080\u0090score: \u00e2\u0080\u00930.78; mean Hb concentration (g/L): 128.06; mean proportion of underweight students: 0.07; mean proportion of anaemic students: 0.22; DDS (adapted from FAO guidelines): 5.12.

Table A1: most variables were quite balanced across groups, with minor differences due to sampling errors, suggesting that the random group assignments were done reasonably well. However, due to the modest number (i.e. 59) of project schools, some student or school characteristics may have been balanced across the 3 groups (Appendix A Table A1), even under randomised group assignments. To address this issue, the authors modified the estimating equation. Quote: \"Unless otherwise stated, all estimates presented below are obtained after controlling for the full set of covariates reported in Appendix A Table A1.\"Attrition per relevant group: 61% of boarding students (who were considered in the analysis) were not analysed because they did not have health information collected due to budgetary reasons. Considering the full sample of 6994, attrition was 88%.Description of subgroups measured and reported: NRTotal number completed and analysed per relevant group: to fully capture the impacts of the treatments, the authors' analysis focused only on the 2199 boarding students in the sample (of 6994 students). Due to budgetary reasons, while dietary information was collected from all (boarding) students, health information was collected only from about half of them: 1020 boarding students had information on Hb concentration level, 952 had height and weight information, and 866 had both sets of information. Thus, the final analytical sample comprised 866 boarding students with information available on all 3 dimensions. Students: 219/582 (38%) for nutrition subsidy; 210/563 (36%) for nutrition subsidy + monetary incentive; 437/1550 (28%) for control group.Total number enrolled per relevant group: total sample 6994. Not clear per group, as only reported on those with Hb and height/weight information.Total number randomised per relevant group: total of 15 schools for nutrition subsidy, 15 for nutrition subsidy + monetary incentive and 29 for control group.\t \tInterventions\tIntervention characteristicsNutrition subsidy (treatment group 1)Food access intervention category: food pricesIntervention type: food subsidyDescription: nutrition subsidy with a general policy target of 'malnutrition reduction'. The monetary equivalent of the total amount of nutrition subsidy provided to each school in this group was CNY 225 (USD 33) per enrolled student (which cost CNY 1.5/day, enough for purchasing 60 g of red meat, for 150 days). The subsidy money was transferred to the bank account of each school and the schoolmasters were able to use this money for nutrition\u00e2\u0080\u0090related expenses (in any way they deemed reasonable). In addition, each schoolmaster in this treatment group was informed about the main aim of the intervention project (i.e. to reduce child malnutrition) and was given 3 pieces of additional information: 1. the proportion of enrolled students who were anaemic (not the specific individuals but the mean rate of the whole school), 2. descriptions of effective methods for reducing iron\u00e2\u0080\u0090deficient anaemia and 3. details about anaemia's relation with school attendance, educational performance and cognitive development. However, the project team did not provide any specific instructions or stipulate specific requirements on what foods the schools should purchase; schoolmasters were allowed to make their own decisions on how the subsidy money was spent to achieve the goal of malnutrition reduction.Duration of intervention period: 6 months: November 2009\u00e2\u0080\u0093May 2010, with a 1\u00e2\u0080\u0090month pause during the winter break in February 2010.Frequency: 1Number of study contacts: 2 contacts: baseline (October 2009) and follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up (May 2010).Providers: project team and local government.Delivery: CNY 225 (equivalent to USD 33) per student, enough to purchase 60 g of red meat per day for 150 days, was transferred into the school's bank account.Co\u00e2\u0080\u0090interventions: NRResource requirements: CNY 225 per student. Human resource requirements were minimal, as the money was transferred to the school bank account and administered by the schoolmasters.Economic indicators: NRNutrition subsidy + monetary incentive (treatment group 2)Food access intervention category: food pricesIntervention type: food subsidy with additional incentiveDescription: nutrition subsidy identical to treatment group 1, + a specific policy target of 'anaemia reduction'. Involved an incentive in the form of a potential monetary bonus provided to schoolmasters; amount was tied to actual reductions in anaemia prevalence among students in their schools \u00e2\u0080\u0093 more specifically, a schoolmaster would receive a CNY 150 (or USD 22) bonus for each of his other students whose status changed from being anaemic to being non\u00e2\u0080\u0090anaemic over the course of the intervention. As with schoolmasters in treatment group 1, those in treatment group 2 were informed about the main aim of the intervention project (i.e. to reduce child malnutrition) and were provided with the same 3 pieces of anaemia\u00e2\u0080\u0090related information. Similarly, they were allowed to make their own decisions on how the subsidy money was spent; no requirements were imposed by the project team or the local government.Duration of intervention period: November 2009\u00e2\u0080\u0093May 2010, with a pause of 1 month (February 2010) during the winter break.Frequency: 1Number of study contacts: 2 contacts: baseline (October 2009) and follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up (May 2010).Providers: project team and local government.Delivery: CNY 225 (equivalent to USD 33) per student, enough to purchase 60 g of red meat per day for 150 days, was transferred into the school's bank account. Since the bonus provided to schoolmasters in treatment group 2 would not be realised until the end of the intervention period when the actual reductions in anaemia prevalence were revealed (note that it may not even be realised if there are no reductions in anaemia prevalence), the actual amount of subsidy per student received by the 2 treatment groups (i.e. the amount that could be used for food purchase per student terms) was identical during the intervention.Co\u00e2\u0080\u0090interventions: NRResource requirements: CNY 225 per student, + CNY 150 for each anaemic student converted to non\u00e2\u0080\u0090anaemic.

Daidone 2014 Study characteristics\t \tMethods\tStudy design: cRCTStudy grouping: parallel groupHow were missing data handled? investigated attrition at 24\u00e2\u0080\u0090month follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up by testing for similarities at baseline between 1. treatment and control groups for all non\u00e2\u0080\u0090missing HHs (differential attrition) and 2. all HHs at baseline and the remaining HHs at the 24\u00e2\u0080\u0090month follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up (overall attrition). Testing these groups on baseline characteristics can assess whether the benefits of randomisation are preserved at follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up. There was no significant differential attrition at 24\u00e2\u0080\u0090month follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up, meaning that benefits of randomisation were preserved. There were small differences between study population at baseline and those that remained at 24\u00e2\u0080\u0090month follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up; the remaining HHs were less likely to have experienced a shock, especially flooding or drought at baseline, and they consumed a higher proportion of maize over cassava. The differences from overall attrition were primarily driven by the lower response rate in Kaputa district.Randomisation ratio: about 1:1Recruitment method: 90/300 CWACs in the 3 districts were randomly selected and ranked through a lottery to be considered in the programme. In second phase, CWAC members and Ministry staff identified all eligible HHs with \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 1 child under the age of 3 years living in these 90 randomly selected communities. This resulted in > 100 eligible HHs in each of the CWACs.Sample size justification and outcome used: power analysis completed to ensure study size was able to detect meaningful effects.Sampling method: randomised phase\u00e2\u0080\u0090in method that included several levels of random selection. First, 90/300 CWACs in the 3 districts were randomly selected and ranked through a lottery to be considered in the programme. In second phase, CWAC members and Ministry staff identified all eligible HHs with \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 1 child under the age of 3 years living in these 90 randomly selected communities. This resulted in > 100 eligible HHs in each of the CWACs. After implementing a power analysis to ensure the study was able to detect meaningful effects, 28 HHs were randomly selected for inclusion in the evaluation from each of the 90 communities. This yielded a final study sample of > 2500 HHs. Baseline data collection carried out before CWACs were randomly assigned to treatment and control. Importantly, neither the HHs nor the enumerators knew who would benefit first and who would benefit later. Randomisation was concluded with the flip of a coin and was carried out in public with local officials, Ministry staff and community members.Study aim or objective: CGP has 6 specific objectives: 1. supplement and not replace HH income; 2. increase the number of children enrolled in and attending school; 3. reduce the rate of mortality and morbidity among children aged < 5 years; 4. reduce stunting and wasting among children aged < 5 years; 5. increase the number of HHs owning assets such as livestock and 6. increase the number of HHs that have a second meal a day.Study period: 3\u00e2\u0080\u0090year RCT; began in December 2010 and ended in 2013.

Doocy 2017 Study characteristics\t \tMethods\tStudy design: PCSStudy grouping: N/AHow were missing data handled? With exception of imputation procedures for child anthropometric data, analysis did not consider interim measures of each indicator because after exploratory analysis, it became clear that inclusion of interim data points did not change results and conclusions, and thus eliminating analysis of interim measures would facilitate the interpretation of findings. Used a multiple imputation approach for anthropometric outcomes, where missing values were replaced by values sampled from a distribution defined by the fit of a linear regression model at a given follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up as a function of previous outcomes, as well as of child age and sex. Missing values for maternal age was assigned the mean and education the mode of those variables, so they could be included in the analysis.Randomisation ratio: N/ARecruitment method: at enrolment, a full description of study was read to prospective participants and they had the opportunity to ask questions about participation; those who agreed to participate gave oral consent due to high levels of illiteracy. At each subsequent survey, the respondent was read an abbreviated consent statement and asked to re\u00e2\u0080\u0090affirm their willingness to participate prior to the interview (Doocy 2018). Study enrolment occurred between August and October 2012 following identification of beneficiaries for each intervention. 1820 beneficiaries and their HHs were enrolled and followed over 3.5 years during February/March 2016; study HHs were followed for the entire period, regardless of whether they graduated or dropped out of intervention.Sample size justification and outcome used: primary outcome measure was reduction in HH food insecurity, and authors conducted calculations for varying levels of reduction, assuming 80% power and a significance level of 0.05. With a minimum sample size of 325 HHs per group (or 1625 HHs in total for the parent study), study was powered to detect a 10% or greater reduction in prevalence of food insecurity indicators within each comparison group compared to baseline levels.Sampling method: The Jenga Jamaa II parent study used a quasi\u00e2\u0080\u0090experimental matched design in which communities planned to receive 1 intervention (vs multiple interventions) selected for participation so that the effect of individual interventions could be assessed. Authors analysed 2 of the 5 comparison groups recruited for the parent study of Jenga Jamaa II: the FFS intervention group (388 participants) and the control group (324 participants). Participating communities within each territory (Fizi and Uvira) were matched by livelihood zone (mountains, plains or lakeside) and proximity into sets of villages with each type of intervention. The final sample had 13 sets of 3 villages; within each set of villages, 1 village received agricultural interventions, 1 received PM2A, and 1 received WEGs. In each set of villages, intervention groups were formed (i.e. 1 intervention per village) and all beneficiaries in the group were enrolled in the study. In agricultural intervention villages, the entire FFS group of approximately 30 beneficiaries was enrolled in the study. Controls were selected from WEG villages, where each beneficiary was matched with a female neighbour not participating in Jenga Jamaa II interventions, and that woman's HH was enrolled as a control. Villages were assigned to an intervention based on agreement with local leaders and availability programme resources; intervention participants were identified based on programme targeting criteria and community selection processes. Once intervention groups were formed, all group members were invited to participate in the research. In agriculture villages, 1 FFS with approximately 30 participants was enrolled; 1 of 3 farmer\u00e2\u0080\u0090to\u00e2\u0080\u0090farmer trainees of each FFS participant was randomly selected to comprise the F2F group. In WEG villages, 1 WEG group of 25 participants was selected. Members of the control group were also selected from WEG villages because the WEG intervention had lower coverage than FFS/farmer\u00e2\u0080\u0090to\u00e2\u0080\u0090farmer and PM2A interventions (i.e. there was only 1 WEG group per village compared to multiple PM2A and agricultural intervention groups), which lessened the likelihood of spillover effects on control HHs.Study aim or objective: to examine the changes in agricultural production practices, HH food security and child nutritional status that are associated with participation in FFS programmes. Study derived from a subset of data from the parent study of Jenga Jamaa II which sought to address HH food insecurity and child undernutrition through 1. increasing incomes among farming HHs through FFS and farmer\u00e2\u0080\u0090to\u00e2\u0080\u0090farmer training interventions, 2. improving the health and nutritional status of children aged < 5 years through the PM2A, and 3. empowering women via WEGs.Study period: HHs were followed for 3.5 years, from enrolment in autumn of 2012 (baseline) to February or March 2016 (endline).Unit of allocation or exposure: villages\t \tParticipants\tBaseline characteristicsFFSsAge: n, mean, years: 37.9 (SD 13.4); children aged < 2 years, n, mean: 0.5 (SD 0.5); children aged 2\u00e2\u0080\u00934 years, n, mean: 1.5 (SD 1.1)Place of residence, %: proportion in Fizi territory: 46.2; proportion in Uvira territory: 53.8Sex: female, %: 69.4Ethnicity and language: NROccupation: NREducation: mean years of education: 3.4 (SD 3.6)SES: number of income sources, mean: 2.0 (SD 1.0); proportion with land ownership, %: 69.5; HH size, mean: 6.2 (SD 2.4)Social capital: NRNutritional status: HDDS, mean: 3.4 (SD 1.4); proportion moderately and severely food insecure (HFIAS), %: 97.8Morbidities: NRConcomitant or previous care: NRControlAge: children aged < 2 years, n, mean: 0.7 (SD 0.5); children aged 2\u00e2\u0080\u00934 years, n, mean: 1.8 (SD 1.1)Place of residence: proportion in Fizi territory, %: 46.2; proportion in Uvira territory, %: 53.8Sex: NREthnicity and language: NROccupation: NREducation: NRSES: mean number of income sources: 1.8 (SD 0.9); proportion with land ownership, %: 68.6; HH size, mean: 6.3 (SD 2.4)Social capital: NRNutritional status: mean HDDS: 3.4 (SD 1.5); proportion moderately and severely food insecure (HFIAS), %: 98.4Morbidities: NRConcomitant or previous care: NRWEGsAge: mean, years: 34.0 (SD 8.8)Place of residence: proportion in Fizi territory, %: 46.2; proportion in Uvira territory, %: 53.8Sex: female, %: 100Ethnicity and language: NROccupation: NREducation: mean years of education: 2.8 (SD 3.1)SES: mean number of income sources: 1.9 (SD 0.9); proportion with land ownership, %: 70.2; HH size, mean: 6.6 (SD 2.3)Social capital: NRNutritional status: mean HDDS: 3.4 (SD 1.7); proportion moderately and severely food insecure (HFIAS), %: 99Morbidities: NRConcomitant or previous care: NROverall (all intervention groups; including those irrelevant to the review)Age: mean, years: 33.4 (SD 11.4)Place of residence: proportion in Fizi territory, %: 46.2; proportion in Uvira territory, %: 53.8Sex: female, %: 86.1Ethnicity and language: NROccupation: NREducation: mean years of education: 3.1 (SD 3.5)SES: mean number of income sources: 1.9 (SD 0.9); proportion with land ownership, %: 69.7Social capital: NRNutritional status: mean HDSS: 3.4 (SD 1.5); proportion moderately and severely food insecure (HFIAS), %: 98.5Morbidities: NRConcomitant or previous care: NRInclusion criteria: intervention participants identified based on programme targeting criteria and community selection processes.

Each FFS group received semimonthly training from ADRA field agents for 2 years. Each FFS group had a community demonstration plot, and group members also received starter packages of seeds and tools for use on individual farms. The FFS programmes focused on a variety of common crops in the region, including cassava, maize, rice, beans, banana and peanuts. The first year of training focused on knowledge of production systems and technologies; second year focused on adoption of techniques and technologies, and behaviour change. Content was designed to be crop\u00e2\u0080\u0090specific and seasonally appropriate. After completing the FFS intervention, many beneficiaries transitioned to farmer business associations, which were intended to improve access to credit and marketing opportunities.Duration of intervention period: 3.5 yearsFrequency: every 2 weeksNumber of study contacts: 8 (August/September 2012; February/March 2013; August/September 2013; February/March 2014; August/September 2014; February/March 2015; August/September 2015; February/March 2016)Providers: implemented by ADRA.Delivery: training sessions on agriculture techniques and other content by field agents, with a community demonstration plot; provision of starter packages of seeds and tools; some reports of delayed seed arrival and inefficient tools that delayed processes. Insecurity complicated both programme delivery and data collection in some communities. Possible that spillover from the intervention areas affected the control areas.Co\u00e2\u0080\u0090interventions: some FFS participants trained 3 farmers from their community in FFS techniques (F2F programme). This was supposed to be a scalable and less resource intensive intervention to increase agricultural input.

Evans 2014 Study characteristics\t \tMethods\tStudy design: cRCTStudy grouping: parallel groupHow were missing data handled? Authors carried out both ETT and ITT regressions. However, in ETT analyses, treated HHs were those assigned to the intervention and actually received the intervention, whereas in an ITT analysis 'treated' HHs were those that were assigned to intervention, regardless of whether they actually received it. It appears as data not collected was excluded from the analysis.Randomisation ratio: 1:1; 40 intervention and 40 control communitiesRecruitment method: HHs were invited to enrol in the pilot. Enrolment of beneficiaries carried out in each community, with the enrolment process lasting 1\u00e2\u0080\u00933 days, depending on total number of beneficiary HHs in the community. The enrolment team identified who would receive payments in each HH (usually the mother of the children in the HH if present), updated family information, linked children and the elderly with schools and health centres, provided an orientation session about the programme, and provided identity cards.Sample size justification and outcome used: once all communities were assigned into groups, power calculations identified the need to interview a mean of 25 HHs per community. With a total of 80 participating communities (40 treatment and 40 control) and a standardised effect size of 0.20, it was expected to need to interview 20 HHs per community to achieve 80% power. 25 HHs per community were then interviewed since not every HH would have vulnerable children: some few HHs would only have vulnerable elderly people. Calculation assumed 95% CIs for statistical significance and an intracluster correlation of 0.05.Sampling method: pilot study implemented in districts and communities targeted under TASAF I, which targeted the poorest and most vulnerable districts of Tanzania using a rigorous selection process. Regions were ranked using several indicators (poverty level, food insecurity, primary school gross enrolment ratio, access to safe water, access to health facilities, AIDS case rates and road accessibility). Districts were then prioritised within the regions using an index of relative poverty and deprivation constructed using data from Tanzania's 1992 Income and Expenditure Survey. Targeting done using screening forms designed to identify vulnerable children and elderly people based on specific criteria, which were defined by the communities themselves. The CMCs used these poverty indicators to identify the poorest (approximately) half of HHs in the community. Validation of the list of eligible HHs was done by the village assembly, allowing for community validation. They ranked HHs by priority. Random selection of control and treatment communities was done after identification of vulnerable HHs in all 80 communities.Study aim or objective: pilot project aiming to develop operational modalities for the community\u00e2\u0080\u0090driven delivery of a CCT programme through a social fund operation; and test the effectiveness of the community\u00e2\u0080\u0090based CCT model and ensure that lessons from the pilot informed government policy on support for vulnerable families.Study period: 31\u00e2\u0080\u009334 months: January 2010 (when first payments were made) to October 2012 (endline survey).Unit of allocation or exposure: communities (with random selection of HHs within communities allocated to each intervention group)\t \tParticipants\tBaseline characteristicsIntervention or exposureAge: adults aged 18\u00e2\u0080\u009359 years, n: 1.08; children, n: 1.69; elderly people, n: 1.91Place of residence: villages in TanzaniaSex: NREthnicity and language: NROccupation: HHs in agricultural self\u00e2\u0080\u0090employment, %: about 72Education: child ever in school (% children): 78.36; child (aged 6\u00e2\u0080\u009317 years) now in school: 86.98; repeated a grade (% children in school); taken a national examination (% children in school): 98.09; own exercise books (% children in school): 94.48SES, % HH: bank account: 1.6; borrowed part year: 19.3; improved roof: 33.0; improved floor: 3.0; improved toilet: 69.1; piped water: 30.2; electricity: 0.0Social capital: contributed labour to a community development project, % HHs: 36.25.

USD 3 per month for orphans and vulnerable children aged \u00e2\u0089\u00a4 15 years (about 50% of food poverty line). Initially TZS 3600, but later revised to TZS 5100 to account for inflation. USD 6 per month for elderly people aged \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 60 years (100% of food poverty line). Initially this was TZS 7200 but was later revised to TZS 10,500. No HH received < USD 6 per month, and no HH received > USD 18 per month. Funds routed to communities through the local government authorities. Payments disbursed by TASAF to a bank account managed by the LGA, which disbursed the funds directly to the community\u00e2\u0080\u0090managed accounts. If the local government was not qualified to receive capital development grants, TASAF disbursed the funds directly to the community\u00e2\u0080\u0090managed accounts. CMCs were then responsible for making payments to beneficiary HHs. Education conditions: enrolment in primary school and individual attendance for children aged 7\u00e2\u0080\u009315 years. Health conditions: visit to health facility for growth monitoring 6 times a year for children aged 0\u00e2\u0080\u00935 years; vaccination and growth monitoring for children aged 0\u00e2\u0080\u00932 years; yearly visit to health facility for routine check and orientation for elderly people (aged \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 60 years). A module on community score cards was used as part of the intervention itself to enhance the accountability and process monitoring of the CCT roll out.Duration of intervention period: 31\u00e2\u0080\u009334 months: January 2010 to August\u00e2\u0080\u0093October 2012Frequency: cash transfers every 2 monthsNumber of study contacts: 3: baseline: January\u00e2\u0080\u0093May 2009; Midline: July\u00e2\u0080\u0093September 2011; endline: August\u00e2\u0080\u0093October 2012Providers: Tanzania Social Action Fund, World Bank, community management communities, village assembly, village council, local government authoritiesDelivery: funds routed to communities through the local government authorities. In districts where the local government was certified compliant via Tanzania's Local Government Development Capital Grant programme, TASAF disbursed 5 payments to a bank account managed by the LGA, which disbursed the funds directly to the community\u00e2\u0080\u0090managed accounts. If the local government was not qualified to receive capital development grants, TASAF disbursed the funds directly to the community\u00e2\u0080\u0090managed accounts. The CMCs were then responsible for making payments to beneficiary HHs. Monitoring of conditions began after the first payment was disbursed to beneficiaries in January 2010, and then was done every 4 months. The monitoring process was conducted by TASAF and the CMCs, with support from schools, health centres and district staff. If beneficiaries failed to comply with the conditions, a warning was issued to them by the CMCs. If, after the next monitoring period (8 months after the first payment), beneficiaries still failed to comply with conditions, payments were reduced by 25% and a second warning was sent. After 2 warnings, beneficiaries who failed to comply were suspended indefinitely, but allowed to return to the programme after review and approval by the communities and TASAF. CMCs were responsible for monitoring and also visited beneficiary HHs regularly to keep abreast of any developments. HHs could also leave or be asked to leave the programme for the following reasons: if they chose to opt out, and had informed the CMC, if the HH no longer had an elderly person or a child age < 15 years who was in primary school, if HH members failed to comply with conditions after a warning had been issued 3 consecutive times for children and 2 consecutive times for elderly people.Co\u00e2\u0080\u0090interventions: transfers from government/TASAF or from NGOs/religious organisationResource requirements: 'staff' involved in delivering intervention: CMCs village council, village assembly.

WHZ data coded as missing if WHZ > +5 or WHZ < \u00e2\u0080\u00935; HAZ data coded as missing if HAZ > +5 or HAZ < \u00e2\u0080\u00936. A child's data were excluded from the analysis if the child was deemed to be a different child to the child enrolled at baseline. While checks were in place to ensure that the same child was measured every month, in some cases these were not followed. Used criteria for exclusion a decrease in height or length > 1 cm (measurement error) or an increase > 15 cm (considered the maximum height a child could grow in 6 months). All effect analyses were ITT.Randomisation ratio: 1:1:1:1Recruitment method: Action Against Hunger provided the initial HH lists, and these were further verified and updated by the study research team. HHs defined as poor and very poor were selected. Field officers then visited identified HHs to share details of study and get informed consent before collecting baseline data. Study participants were enrolled by data collection team and were unaware which intervention they would be getting at enrolment. However, blinding of participants was not possible due to nature of intervention. Data collection team was different to cash and voucher disbursement team. Data collection team was responsible for collection of data and sensitisation of the study recipients to use of cash and vouchers. Data collection team was accompanied by local research mobilisers who facilitated the data collectors (e.g. in locating HHs), and were responsible for delivering key BCC messages.Sample size justification and outcome used: target sample size (about 632 HHs per group) was calculated to measure a detectable difference of prevalence of being wasted of 7% between the intervention and the control groups postintervention. Sample size was powered to detect a 0.19 WHZ difference between the intervention and the control groups. Sample size was reached for the standard cash transfer, food voucher and control groups. However, for the double cash transfer group, the sample size was 600 due to the different funding amounts given for this group, which did not allow for an equivalent number of HHs to be included compared to the other 3 groups. Target sample size was calculated using an estimated ICC of 0.02 for prevalence of being wasted from an Action Against Hunger nutrition survey in Dadu District. ICC for prevalence of being wasted was 0.01 (Fenn 2017).Sampling method: it was not possible to carry out a public randomisation, therefore, randomisation was done by the principal investigator using a random number table to generate the randomisation sequence and then drawing village names from a box. Block randomisation was done, allowing equal distribution of the villages to each group for small (< 40 HHs), medium (40 (SD 85) HHs) and large (> 85 HHs) villages. The investigator had no knowledge of the villages involved and was not involved in the intervention implementation or any data collection. HHs were selected from villages from 3 agricultural areas sharing similar livelihoods, geography and access to the same elements of the standard WINS programme. Action Against Hunger provided the initial HH lists, and these were further verified and updated by the study research team. HHs defined as poor or very poor using eligibility criteria decided by research team with village participation, and based on ownership of cultivated land and number of goats and with \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 1 children aged 6\u00c2\u00b148 months were selected. The study was a closed cohort and followed all children in the same eligible HHs regardless of their baseline anthropometric status.Study aim or objective: to evaluate 3 cash\u00e2\u0080\u0090based transfer modalities on nutritional outcomes in children aged < 5 years from poor and very poor HHs in Dadu District, Sindh Province, Pakistan. Aimed to 1. compare the nutrition status of children receiving either a seasonal UCTs or a fresh food voucher with those with access to Action Against Hunger care only, after 6 months and 1 year; 2. assess the costs and cost\u00e2\u0080\u0090effectiveness of the different interventions; 3. understand the factors that determined the ways in which HHs used the different transfers and 4. explore the role of the different processes involved in the study outcomes and how they interact with the context (Fenn 2015).Study period: data for the main impact analysis and findings reported here involved 3 periods: baseline (May\u00e2\u0080\u0093July 2015), 6 months after baseline (December 2015), and 1 year after baseline (June/July 2016).Unit of allocation or exposure: villages\t \tParticipants\tBaseline characteristicsStandard cash transferAge: child, months, mean: 25.6 (SD 12.3)Place of residence: NRSex: girls, n/N (%): 433/905 (47.9)Ethnicity and language: ethnicity, n (%): Sindhi 587 (94.2), Balochi 36 (5.8), Punjabi 0 (0).

HHs defined as poor or very poor using eligibility criteria decided upon by the research team with village participation, and based on ownership of cultivated land and number of goats and with \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 1 children aged 6 (SD 48) months were selected.Exclusion criteria: NRPretreatment: baseline characteristics of clusters and participants between the different intervention and control groups were well balanced for mothers and their children, apart from the proportion of children who had received deworming treatment, which was lower in the control group. There were a few potential imbalances at the HH level and between villages due to the clustered nature of the study design. These included village size, ethnicity, access to safe water and distance to nearest health service. In the control group, there was a higher proportion of HHs of Balochi ethnicity. There also appeared to be differences in the SES and educational status of mothers and fathers (both lower) and a higher number of HHs participating in the BISP in control group (Fenn 2017).Attrition per relevant group: no evaluation clusters LTFU; response rates for HHs were 95.6% and children were 98.3% within clusters at 6 months and for HHs were 95.0% and children were 96.8% at 1 year. 109 (1.6%) children missing (WHZ outliers, excluded children, missing data at either time point): control 31, double cash 32, food voucher 24 standard cash 22.

Action Against Hunger ensured that all food voucher villages had good access to these shops, by nominating shops in, or nearby, these villages. All villages were served by \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 1 nominated shop. Vouchers were disbursed at same time every month for 6 consecutive months.Duration of intervention period: 6 months (July 2015 to December 2015)Frequency: monthlyNumber of study contacts: baseline; 6 months; 12 monthsProviders: funded by the EU.Delivery: food vouchers disbursed to participating HHs at the village level. Disbursement of cash and vouchers was done by different organisations. The food voucher group had more direct contact with Action Against Hunger field staff during voucher disbursement, which could have affected the results through greater exposure to key messages. It is also possible that the vouchers themselves were too restricted. They were designed to purchase fresh fruit, vegetables, and fresh meat and were, therefore, dependent on what the vendors stocked, such as chicken being the only available meat. There were also many anecdotal reports regarding vendors overcharging for food items redeemed against the vouchers as a way to cover their own administration fees in recovering the voucher costs. In this respect, the actual transfer value given may have been lower than the face value.Co\u00e2\u0080\u0090interventions: all villages had access to the WINS programme, which provided outpatient treatment for children aged 6 (SD 59) months with severe acute malnutrition, micronutrient supplementation (children and pregnant and lactating women) and BCC.

Parishes stratified into rural and urban groups and from each group, treatment and comparison parishes were randomly selected.Study aim or objective: to analyse the impact of a programme that transfers cash to women in rural Ecuador on measures of ECD (Paxson 2010). First objective was to use a randomised effectiveness trial in Ecuador to address the question of whether very young children (aged 12\u00e2\u0080\u009335 months) benefit in terms of health outcomes or language development if their families receive a cash transfer (Fernald 2011; study included a subset of younger children only).Study period: duration of intervention during which participants received transfers was unclear. Rural families in treatment group were eligible for the transfer for 17 months prior to the follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up survey. Rural families became eligible for transfer from June 2004, and urban families in November 2006 and follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up survey was conducted between September 2005 and January 2006.Unit of allocation or exposure: parishes allocated to intervention and control groups but certain HHs only selected for inclusion in study.\t \tParticipants\tBaseline characteristicsIntervention or exposureAge: mother, years, mean: 26.51 (SE 7.22); child, months, mean: 38.82 (SE 13.13)Place of residence: urban: 46% (365)Sex: child male, mean: 0.494 (SE 0.5)Ethnicity and language: NROccupation: NREducation: mother's education, years, mean: 6.88 (SE 2.94).SES: number of family members, mean: 4.78 (SE 2.19)Social capital: mother living with husband, mean: 0.696 (SE 0.460)Nutritional status: mother's elevation\u00e2\u0080\u0090adjusted Hb, mean: 11.64 (SE 1.44).

Eligible families received USD 15 per month. They were not required to withdraw their USD 15 on a monthly basis but could allow transfers to accumulate for up to 4 months.Duration of intervention period: HHs were eligible for 17 months before follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up, but it was unclear whether they were receiving transfers during the entire period.Frequency: monthlyNumber of study contacts: 2: baseline (October 2003\u00e2\u0080\u0093March 2004) and follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up (September 2005\u00e2\u0080\u0093January 2006)Providers: transfers administered by the Government of Ecuador and distributed through a large network of private banks (Banred) and the National Agricultural Bank (Banco Nacional de Fomento) (Schady Araujo, 2006) (Fernald 2011). Baseline and follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up surveys were conducted by the World Bank and the Government of Ecuador (Fernald 2011)Delivery: transfers were given to mothers rather than fathers and were distributed through the banking system, although beneficiaries did not need to have a bank account to receive them. The fraction of rural families that received transfers among families randomised into the BDH treatment group climbed quickly once the programme became available, reaching 56% by January 2005 and 60% by January 2006. Overall, 75% of sampled families in the treatment parishes received a transfer in \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 1 month since June 2004. Mean monthly transfer across all treatment\u00e2\u0080\u0090group families, between January 2005 and November 2006, was USD 10.51. This was less than amount planned. According to survey response data, there was very little contamination of intervention: take\u00e2\u0080\u0090up of the BDH programme was 73% for the treatment group and 3% for the comparison group.Co\u00e2\u0080\u0090interventions: NRResource requirements: NREconomic indicators: NRControl: no intervention\t \tOutcomes\tAnthropometry: HAZ; heightBiochemical: HbCognitive function and development: language (TVIP score and IDHC\u00e2\u0080\u0090B score); long\u00e2\u0080\u0090term memory; short\u00e2\u0080\u0090term memory; visual integrationAnxiety and depression: mother's depression score (CES\u00e2\u0080\u0090D); mother's PSS\t \tIdentification\tSponsorship source: Center for Economic and Policy Studies at Princeton University, the government of Ecuador, and the World BankCountry: EcuadorSetting: rural and urban parishesAuthor's name: Lia FernaldEmail: fernald@berkeley.eduDeclarations of interest: NRStudy or programme name and acronym: Bono de Desarrollo Humano (BDH) programmeType of record: journal article\t \tNotes\t\u00c2\u00a0\t \tRisk of bias\t \tBias\tAuthors' judgement\tSupport for judgement\t \tRandom sequence generation (Selection bias)\tUnclear risk\tStudy was randomised but authors did not report how random sequence was generated.\t \tAllocation concealment (Selection bias)\tLow risk\tAllocation was at parish level at beginning of study, and all eligible HHs that were in these parishes were either in intervention or control group.

Ferre 2014 Study characteristics\t \tMethods\tStudy design: PCSStudy grouping: N/AHow were missing data handled? exclusions: the high attrition rate in Narayanganj, while not unusual given the high frequency of in and out migration among the residents of urban slums, was clearly a challenge for any social programme targeted towards the urban slum population. Due to this high attrition rate in Narayanganj, the impact evaluation was restricted to the Jaldhaka sample.Randomisation ratio: N/ARecruitment method: project: following a public information campaign on the project objectives and duration, the targeting and enrolment processes were carried out. Shombhob set up an open registration process where interested HHs with \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 1 child aged 0\u00e2\u0080\u009336 months or at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 1 primary school\u00e2\u0080\u0090aged child (or both) were invited to apply for selection. Out of the 37,801 families who applied, the poorest 15,952 families were selected based on their PMT scores. The list of eligible beneficiaries was validated by community leaders, and verified by UP chairmen, and the Mayor's office in case of Narayanganj City Corporation.Sample size justification and outcome used: NR, but eligible families were requested to enrol, and this process was completed in April 2012. The final number of enrolled HHs was 14,125.Sampling method: random: 1. random sample of 3000 HHs drawn from the census list (all HHs in the 5 project unions of Jaldhaka) and interviewed. 2. HHs were randomly selected within each of the 4 demographic groups and within each of 2 PMT score groups (below 25th percentile and between 25th and 50th percentiles). (Note: HHs were assigned to the treatment group by a non\u00e2\u0080\u0090random assignment rule based on the assignment variable. The eligibility for becoming beneficiaries of a programme was solely determined by whether they were below or above the unique cut\u00e2\u0080\u0090off point.)Study aim or objective: 1. to test the delivery of CCTs to the poorest HHs through local governments to reduce their HH poverty levels; 2. increase school attendance of beneficiary children going to primary school, and 3. improve the nutritional status of beneficiary children aged 0\u00e2\u0080\u009336 months.Study period: baseline (survey conducted): May/June 2011.

Of the 37,801 families who applied for the programme, the poorest 15,952 were selected based on their PMT scores. This meant the cut\u00e2\u0080\u0090off thresholds for selection was a PMT score of 660 for the 2 rural Upazilas. Eligible families had scores below the treatment cut\u00e2\u0080\u0090off (treatment group) and ineligible families with had scores above the cut\u00e2\u0080\u0090off (control group).Exclusion criteria: PMT score above the cut\u00e2\u0080\u0090off.Pretreatment: most of the differences between the treatment and control HHs were nutrition outcomes. Treatment HHs appeared to be worse off compared to the control HHs in the incidence of stunting, wasting, underweight, knowledge of breastfeeding and dietary diversity. The same is true in terms of HH consumption. However, school attendance (defined as the number of classes missed in the last 2 weeks) and enrolment rates were almost identical. The DiD estimator assumes that the mean change in the control group represents the counterfactual change in the treatment group if there was no treatment. This allows a reliable inference of programme impact by comparing the pre\u00e2\u0080\u0090 to postintervention change in the outcome of interest for the treated group relative to a control group.Attrition per relevant group: Jaldhaka (rural): 114Description of subgroups measured and reported: NRTotal number completed and analysed per relevant group: Jaldhaka (rural) analysed only.

Condition: regular school attendance (\u00e2\u0089\u00a5 80% every month) for enrolled children in primary school.Duration of intervention period: due to start up delays, implementation began in February 2012, allowing transfers to be provided for 21 months (from April 2012 to December 2013). In addition, the project faced additional implementation challenges due to the annual floods that hit the project locations during August and September. School closures due to these floods constituted the most serious implementation challenge given focus of the transfers on regular school attendance. These implementation challenges coupled with the fact that the impact evaluation only covered 13 months of cash transfers were likely to affect the impact of the intervention on some indicators.Frequency: bi\u00e2\u0080\u0090monthly cash transfersNumber of study contacts: 2Providers: local governmentsDelivery: innovative electronic payments system developed with the BPO, which provided cash cards to beneficiary mothers to make transfers electronically to their accounts with the Post Office.

The BPO arranged for a mobile team to travel with the machines and cash to the village centres on a designated day during each payment cycle.

The administrative cost associated with the delivery of the services under the pilot intervention, including the development of an automated MIS was about USD 641,000. This meant that the cost to deliver the transfer was USD 1.4 per child per month, or about 28% of the monthly transfer amount of USD 5.Control: no intervention\t \tOutcomes\tProportion of HH expenditure on foodDiet diversity: proportion of children aged \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 6 months fed from \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 4 food groupsAnthropometry: stunting (HAZ < \u00e2\u0080\u00932SD); wasting (WHZ < \u00e2\u0080\u00932SD); underweight (WAZ < \u00e2\u0080\u00932SD)\t \tIdentification\tSponsorship source: South Asia Food and Nutrition Security Initiative (SAFANSI) and the Rapid Social Response (RSR) MDTF of the World BankCountry: BangladeshSetting: rural only.

Awareness campaign ran for 2 weeks (first week of August 2010 to 13 August 2010). It initially targeted groups of 15\u00e2\u0080\u009320 people, but, because ration shop owners tried to influence people to avoid participation in experiment, group sizes were reduced to 5 or 6 people at a time, to make their participation less noticeable.Sample size justification and outcome used: NRSampling method: random selection of 350 HHs that had agreed to participate, of which 50 dropped out.

List of beneficiary HHs presented to a community assembly for review and discussion and list was changed according to established criteria for the selection of beneficiary families (process called densification). No other criteria reported.Exclusion criteria: NRPretreatment: overall, communities were comparable but this was not the case at HH or individual level. HHs in the intervention group were bigger, had more children but fewer adults aged > 55 years compared to control group (Hoddinott 2003). No difference in illness rates or number of visits to clinics for nutrition monitoring between control and treatment groups (Gertler 2000).Attrition per relevant group: overall attrition varied between papers and there was no report of attrition per group. 3350/12,291 (27%) intervention HHs did not receive the intervention by March 2000. Of these, 2872 HHs were not incorporated into programme; 478 HHs chose not to participate (no official records) or moved out of locality (Skoufias 2005). Attrition per group NR. In total, 221 HHs excluded as reported no food was consumed within the home, and 7165 HHs excluded with caloric availability per person per day < 875 kcal or > 4.768 kcal (Hoddinott 2003).Description of subgroups measured and reported: NRTotal number completed and analysed per relevant group: total 16,614 HHs, which excluded 7386 HHs that were excluded because of inadequate data. Number analysed per group NR and also varied depending on report.Total number enrolled per relevant group: 320 communities allocated to intervention and 186 to control groups, out of 506 communities. 24,000 HHs overall in sample at beginning of study (Hoddinott 2003). 97% of HHs enrolled in programme (Gertler 2000). Baseline sample included 112,319 individuals from 18,795 HHs in 506 experimental communities. Approximately, 60% of sample came from treatment areas and 40% from control (Gertler 2000).Total number randomised per relevant group: intervention group: 320 communities; control group: 186 communities\t \tInterventions\tIntervention characteristicsIntervention or exposureFood access intervention category: increase buying powerIntervention type: CCTDescription: cash transfers to families every 2 months (food and education transfers) if: 1. every family member accepted preventive health services; 2. children aged 0\u00e2\u0080\u00935 years and lactating mothers attended nutrition monitoring clinics where their growth was measured (every 2 months for children under 24 months), immunisation, obtained nutrition supplements and they received education on nutrition and hygiene; and 3. pregnant women visited clinics to obtain antenatal care (5 visits), nutritional supplements and health education. Linked to children's school enrolment and regular school attendance and clinic attendance. Included in\u00e2\u0080\u0090kind health benefits; nutritional supplements for children aged \u00e2\u0089\u00a4 5 years, and pregnant and lactating women; and instructional meetings on health and nutritional issues. Transfers were targeted to mothers of the families (female head of HH). 3 types of monetary transfers: 1. scholarships tied to children's school attendance; 2. money for school supplies and 3. transfers for food. Amount of food transfer was 20% of HH monthly consumption expenditure preintervention. Scholarship transfers occur monthly (?), and varied depending on age and sex of the child, with maximum scholarship cap of MXN 490 pesos per HH (January\u00e2\u0080\u0093June 98) and MXN 625 per HH (July\u00e2\u0080\u0093December 1999). Food transfer also occur monthly(?) and depended on age and sex of children in HH and compliance with PROGRESA requirements.Duration of intervention period: about 2 years: April/May 1998 (benefits started) to November 1999/March 2000 (control HHs start receiving benefits)Frequency: cash transfers every 2 monthsNumber of study contacts: 4: baseline data (survey March 1998) was unusable; October 1998; June 1999; November 1999Providers: Mexico Government. Health care component administered by Ministry of Health and IMSS\u00e2\u0080\u0090Solidaridad, a branch of the Mexican Social Security Institute, which provides benefits to uninsured individuals in rural areas.Delivery: every second month. Verification of school attendance relied on completion of forms, which had to be completed and returned to PROGRESA before the initiation of payment. This often led to lags in payments. Every 2 months, confirmation of whether children of beneficiary families attend school > 85% of time was submitted to PROGRESA by school teachers and directors, and this triggered receipt of bi\u00e2\u0080\u0090monthly cash transfer for school attendance. Receipt of monetary transfers and nutritional supplements were tied to mandatory healthcare visits to public clinics. Healthcare professionals submitted certification of beneficiary visits to PROGRESA every 2 months, which triggered receipt of cash transfer for food support. About 65% of HHs received the PROGRESA cash transfers, due to administrative errors and delays in the final registration of beneficiary HHs (for more details see Skoufias 2005). Another unique feature was that the cash transfers were given to mother of HH, a strategy designed to target the funds within the HH to improve the children's education and nutrition. Fernald 2009: compliance verified by clinics and schools, and about 1% of HHs were denied cash transfers for non\u00e2\u0080\u0090compliance.Co\u00e2\u0080\u0090interventions: none reported. 1 additional requirement of the PROGRESA programme was that HHs benefiting from PROGRESA were to stop receiving benefits from other pre\u00e2\u0080\u0090existing programmes such as Ninos de Solidaridad, Abasto Social de Leche, de Tortilla and the National Institute of Indigenous people.Resource requirements: community health and education facilitiesEconomic indicators: programme's budget was USD 777 million for 1999 (0.2% of GDP). Cost of intervention: mean monthly payments of MXN 197 per beneficiary HH (November 1998); mean of MXN 99 for food and MXN 91 for school attendance. The programme operated in almost 50,000 rural villages in 31 states. PROGRESA's budget was about USD 800 million or 0.2% of GDP (Gertler 2000).Control: no intervention (started receiving benefits 2 years later)Co\u00e2\u0080\u0090interventions: none reported.

Haushofer 2013 Study characteristics\t \tMethods\tStudy design: RCTStudy grouping: parallelHow were missing data handled? missing data due to attrition excluded from analysis. Analyses were based on total 1372 HHs, which is the sum of HHs at baseline only.Randomisation ratio: 1:1 (503:505)Recruitment method: after HHs and members identified, in private conversation, members were asked questions about demographics, and informed that they had been chosen to receive a cash transfer of KES 25,200 (USD 404). The recipient was informed that this transfer was unconditional, that they were free to spend it however they chose, and that it was a one\u00e2\u0080\u0090time transfer and would not be repeated.Sample size justification and outcome used: sample size 500 individuals in each of the treatment, control and pure control group was chosen based on a power calculation, which showed that a sample of 1000 individuals was sufficient to detect effect sizes of 0.2 SD for all treatment vs pure control HHs with 89% power. Different treatment groups within the treatment groups (male vs female recipient, lump\u00e2\u0080\u0090sum vs monthly, large vs small transfers) could be compared with 60% power (from registry record).Sampling method: purposive sampling of villages and HHs followed by random selection of HHs into treatment or control groups. GiveDirectly selected poor HHs by identifying poor regions of Kenya according to census data. Region chosen was Rarieda, a peninsula in Lake Victoria west of Kisumu in Western Kenya. GiveDirectly identified target villages through a rough estimation of the population of villages and the proportion of HHs lacking a metal roof, which is GiveDirectly's targeting criterion. Identified 126 villages. 63 of these villages were randomly chosen to be treatment villages. Control villages were only surveyed at endline; in these villages, authors sampled 432 HHs referred to as 'pure control' HHs. In treatment villages, second stage of randomisation assigned 50% of HHs to treatment condition, and 50% to control condition. Process resulted in 503 treatment HHs and 505 control HHs in treatment villages at baseline. Note: numbers were different between reports.Study aim or objective: to assess the relative welfare impacts of 3 design features of UCTs: gender of transfer recipient; temporal structure of transfers (monthly vs lump\u00e2\u0080\u0090sum); and magnitude of transfer.Study period: transfers between June 2011 and January 2013Unit of allocation or exposure: HHs\t \tParticipants\tBaseline characteristicsIntervention or exposureAge: treatment effect vs control, coefficient: \u00e2\u0080\u00931.15 (SE 0.86).

Lump\u00e2\u0080\u0090sum transfers: a month was randomly chosen among the 9 months following the date of the initial visit. For receipt of transfer, recipients were provided with a SIM card by Kenya's largest mobile service provider, Safaricom, and asked to activate it and register for Safaricom's mobile money service M\u00e2\u0080\u0090Pesa. HHs with both a primary female and primary male member stratified on recipient gender and randomly assigned the woman or the man to be the transfer recipient in an equal number of HHs. 258/503 treatment HHs were assigned to monthly group, and 245 to the lump\u00e2\u0080\u0090sum group. Total amount of each type of transfer was KES 25,200 (USD 404). Amount included an initial transfer of KES 1200 (USD 19) to incentivise M\u00e2\u0080\u0090Pesa registration, followed by either a lump\u00e2\u0080\u0090sum payment of KES 24,000 (USD 384) lump\u00e2\u0080\u0090sum group, or 9 monthly transfers of KES 2800 (USD 45) each in the monthly group. 137 HHs in the treatment group were randomly chosen and informed in January 2012 that they would receive an additional transfer of KES 70,000 (USD 1112), paid in 7 monthly instalments of KES 10,000 (USD 160), beginning in February 2012. Thus, the transfers previously assigned to these HHs, whether monthly or lump\u00e2\u0080\u0090sum, were augmented by KES 10,000 from February 2012 to August 2012, and, therefore, the total transfer amount received by these HHs was KES 95,200 (USD 1525). The remaining 366 treatment HHs constituted the 'small' transfer group, and received transfers totalling KES 25,200 (USD 404) per HH.Duration of intervention period: 20 months. Transfers were made between June 2011 and January 2013.Frequency: lump sum or monthly transfers. 258/503 treatment HHs assigned monthly group, and 245 to lump\u00e2\u0080\u0090sum group. Total amount of each type of transfer was KES 25,200 (USD 404), which included an initial transfer of KES 1200 (USD 19) to incentivise M\u00e2\u0080\u0090Pesa registration, followed by either a lump\u00e2\u0080\u0090sum payment of KES 24,000 (USD 384) in the lump\u00e2\u0080\u0090sum group, or 9 monthly transfers of KES 2800 (USD 45) each in the monthly condition. In both the monthly and the lump\u00e2\u0080\u0090sum groups, recipients received the initial transfer of KES 1200 immediately following the announcement visit by GiveDirectly. In the monthly group, recipients received the first transfer of KES 2800 on the first of the month following M\u00e2\u0080\u0090Pesa registration, and the remaining 8 transfers of KES 2800 on the first of the 8 following months. In the lump\u00e2\u0080\u0090sum group, recipients received the lump\u00e2\u0080\u0090sum transfer of KES 24,000 on the first of a month chosen randomly among the 9 months following enrolment.Number of study contacts: 2 (baseline and endline)Providers: GiveDirectly NGODelivery: for lump\u00e2\u0080\u0090sum group, a small initial transfer of KES 1200 was sent on the first of the month following the initial GiveDirectly visit as an incentive for prompt registration. Registration had to occur in the name of the designated transfer recipient, rather than any other person. To facilitate easier communication with recipients and reliable transfer delivery, GiveDirectly offered to sell mobile phones to recipient HHs that did not own 1 (by reducing the future transfer by the cost of the phone). In a few additional cases, delays in registration occurred due to delays in obtaining an official identification card, which was a prerequisite for registering with M\u00e2\u0080\u0090Pesa. Withdrawals and deposits could be made at any M\u00e2\u0080\u0090Pesa agent (about 11,000 throughout Kenya). GiveDirectly reported that recipients typically withdrew the entire balance of the transfer upon receipt. Due primarily to registration issues with M\u00e2\u0080\u0090Pesa, 18 treatment HHs had not received transfers at endline, thus, only 485 of the treatment HHs had received transfers.Co\u00e2\u0080\u0090interventions: NRResource requirements: GiveDirectly estimated the mean travel time from recipient HHs to the nearest M\u00e2\u0080\u0090Pesa agent was 42 minutes.Economic indicators: GiveDirectly estimated the mean cost from recipient HHs to the nearest M\u00e2\u0080\u0090Pesa agent at USD 0.64. Withdrawals incur costs between 27% for USD 2 withdrawals and 0.06% for USD 800 withdrawals, with a gradual decrease of the percentage for intermediate amounts. The sender also incurred costs for M\u00e2\u0080\u0090Pesa transfers; according to GiveDirectly's estimates, the costs of transferring money to recipients in this was amount to 1.5% of the transfer amount for foreign exchange fees, and 1.6% for M\u00e2\u0080\u0090Pesa fees. Together with 4.8% of transfers spent on recipient identification and staff costs, GiveDirectly estimated that 92.1% of the donations it received were transferred to recipients' M\u00e2\u0080\u0090Pesa accounts.Control: no intervention\t \tOutcomes\tProportion of HH expenditure on food: Total monthly HH food expenditure (cereals, tubers, meat/fish, dairy, fruit/vegetables, other food, food eaten out,Food security: FSI (based on weighted mean of measures of food security and hunger based on 17 outcome measures)Anthropometry: MUAC; height; weightAnxiety and depression: psychological well\u00e2\u0080\u0090being index (standardised weighted mean of 6 psychological and neurobiological measures); log cortisol; CES\u00e2\u0080\u0090D; Cohen PSS\t \tIdentification\tSponsorship source: NIH Grant R01AG039297 and Cogito Foundation Grant R\u00e2\u0080\u0090116/10 to Johannes Haushofer.Country: KenyaSetting: poor rural villages in KenyaComments: additional documentation: online Appendix.

Hidrobo 2014 Study characteristics\t \tMethods\tStudy design: cRCTStudy grouping: parallelHow were missing data handled? Overall attrition 10%. Authors excluded data from HHs LTFU and with missing data but they constructed worse\u00e2\u0080\u0090case scenarios to assess effects of excluding missing data. Construct worst\u00e2\u0080\u0090case scenarios by assuming those HHs who select into the sample because of treatment (marginal HHs) were at the very top or very bottom of the outcome distribution. No differences in estimates observed in these analyses.Randomisation ratio: neighbourhoods and clusters randomised into 4 treatment groups using percentages of 20/20 for the control and food groups, and 30/30 for the cash and food voucher groups. 80 neighbourhoods and 145 clusters were randomised.Recruitment method: each HH in the selected neighbourhood was visited, mapped and administered a 1\u00e2\u0080\u0090page questionnaire with basic demographic and socioeconomic questions.Sample size justification and outcome used: NRSampling method: Neighbourhoods within urban centres were chosen for the intervention by WFP in consultation with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) as areas that had large numbers of Colombian refugees and relatively high levels of poverty. Each HH was visited, mapped and administered a 1\u00e2\u0080\u0090page questionnaire that consisted of basic demographic and socioeconomic questions designed to develop a PMT to define programme eligibility. However, based on point scores by nationality, the decision was made to automatically enrol all Colombian and mixed\u00e2\u0080\u0090nationality HHs. First, neighbourhoods were randomised to either treatment or control group; second, all treatment clusters (geographical units within neighbourhoods) were randomised to cash, food voucher or food transfer. 1 unexpected complication in study design was change in beneficiary criteria implemented during baseline survey data collection. In process of surveying HHs, it was concluded that the targeting for transfers was too broad, resulting in the inclusion of HHs who were relatively well off. This led to a retargeting process where HHs who were relatively well off were dropped from the programme. Since there were not enough HHs in existing neighbourhoods to replace those that had been excluded and still reach programme enrolment targets, the decision was made to expand coverage to additional neighbourhoods on the outer circle of urban areas. These areas were subsequently rerandomised into treatment groups according to the approximate percentage lost.Study aim or objective: to compare the impact and cost\u00e2\u0080\u0090effectiveness of cash, food vouchers and food transfers on the quantity and quality of food consumed. Objectives were 3\u00e2\u0080\u0090fold: 1. to improve food consumption by facilitating access to more nutritious foods, 2. to increase the role of women in HH decision\u00e2\u0080\u0090making related to food consumption and 3. to reduce tensions between Colombian refugees and host Ecuadorian populations.Study period: May 2011 to October 2011Unit of allocation or exposure: neighbourhoods and clusters (geographical units within neighbourhoods)\t \tParticipants\tBaseline characteristicsControlAge: mean, years: 41.71.

Although USD 40 was less than most HH's total monthly food consumption at baseline, the quantity of food received for each item was higher than what the median HH in the sample consumed at baseline, which suggests that for many HHs the items from the food transfer would be extra\u00e2\u0080\u0090marginal. Nutrition sensitisation was a key component of the programme, aimed at influencing behaviour change and increasing knowledge of recipient HHs, especially in regard to dietary diversity. To ensure a consistent approach to knowledge transfer, a curriculum was developed by WFP to be covered during each monthly training session. Topics included: 1. programme sensitisation and information, 2. family nutrition, 3. food and nutrition for pregnant and lactating women, 4. nutrition for children aged 0\u00e2\u0080\u009312 months and 5. nutrition for children aged 12\u00e2\u0080\u009324 months. All participants regardless of transfer modality participated in training, and transfers were conditional on attendance. In addition to monthly meetings, posters and flyers on nutrition were developed and posted at distribution sites, including supermarkets, banks, food warehouses and community centres to further expose participants across all 3 modalities to messaging. Flyers covered topics such as recommended food groups, daily nutritional requirements, proper sanitation and food preparation processes.Duration of intervention period: May 2011 to October 2011Frequency: monthly food transfer per HHNumber of study contacts: 2: March\u00e2\u0080\u0093April 2011 (baseline) and October\u00e2\u0080\u0093November 2011 (follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up)Providers: WFP (NPO)Delivery: food transfer was valued according to regional market prices at USD 40 and included rice (24 kg), vegetable oil (4 L), lentils (8 kg) and canned sardines (8 cans of 0.425 kg). Although USD 40 was less than most HH's total monthly food consumption at baseline, the quantity of food received for each item was higher than what the median HH in the sample consumed at baseline, which suggested that for many HHs the items from the food transfer would be extramarginal. Transfers were conditional on attending nutrition sensitisation training. Across all modalities, beneficiaries reported extremely high rates of satisfaction with both the programme and programme transparency, believed that the programme was fair, and reported that programme employees treated them with respect. On average, 99% of beneficiaries reported receiving their transfers in totality and 97% reported that they received all information needed to understand how the programme worked. Across the 3 modalities, a minimum of 88% of beneficiaries stated that they received their scheduled payments on time and that they knew how many transfers they would receive. Knowledge gained from the nutrition sensitisation sessions, as measured by a set of questions at baseline and follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up, was also similar across modalities. < 1% of voucher and food beneficiaries reported selling their food or voucher. Food HHs reported that the remainder was saved for later use (29.4%) and shared with others outside the HH (6.8%).Co\u00e2\u0080\u0090interventions: NRResource requirements: food transfer was significantly more expensive due to the cost of transport to distribution sites and rental of storage facilities. Repackaging bulk items for distribution was also costly, accounting for approximately 30% of the cost of food distribution. Moreover, costs of food did not tend to decrease with economies of scale because much of the modality\u00e2\u0080\u0090specific costs were physical resource costs such as transport and re\u00e2\u0080\u0090packaging. In terms of opportunity costs from time spent travelling to the distribution point and waiting to receive their transfers, food beneficiaries spent on average 93 minute.Economic indicators: costs in per\u00e2\u0080\u0090transfer terms: cost to provide a food transfer was USD 11.46 (Appendix Table B.8). It was considerably less expensive to provide cash (USD 42.99 per transfer) or vouchers (USD 43.27 per transfer) than food (USD 58.22 per transfer). Food recipients spend slightly more, USD 2.12, as many had to use taxis to carry home the heavy loads of food given at the distribution points.Cash transferFood access intervention category: increase buying powerIntervention type: CCTDescription: USD 40 transferred monthly onto preprogrammed debit cards. Cash transfer HHs were able to retrieve the cash any time; however, it had to be taken out in bundles of USD 10. Nutrition sensitisation was a key component of the programme, aimed at influencing behaviour change and increasing knowledge of recipient HHs, especially in regard to dietary diversity.

List consisted of cereals, tubers, fruits, vegetables, legumes, meats, fish, milk products and eggs. Food vouchers could be used over a series of 2 visits per month and had to be redeemed within 30 days of receipt. Vouchers were serialised and printed centrally, and were non\u00e2\u0080\u0090transferable.

NRRandomisation ratio: NRRecruitment method: phase 1: all HHs in selected villages could voluntarily participate in the PWP and receive cash or food transfers. Study authors reported that the intervention began after a process of sensitisation in all villages. Phase 2: targeted HHs in selected villages continued with unconditional cash or food transfers according to specific criteria.Sample size justification and outcome used: NRSampling method: phase 1: convenience sample. 79 villages were suitable and could receive either food or cash transfers. Of these, 52 villages were included in final sample since it would have been too complicated/led to tension if proximate villages shared a work site (5670 HHs). Phase 2: 50% of HHs in each village were targeted to receive the same transfer without having to fulfil a work requirement (2786 HHs). Random sample was taken from these HHs for the collection of outcome data such as food security outcomes before the start of the unconditional transfers (2268 HHs).Study aim or objective: to examine the differential impact of food and cash transfers on 5670 HHs eligible for emergency assistance in eastern Niger.Study period: first phase included 3 months of public works (April\u00e2\u0080\u0093June 2011), while second phase provided 3 months of unconditional transfers (July\u00e2\u0080\u0093September 2011) to the most vulnerable HHs during the peak of the lean season.Unit of allocation or exposure: village\t \tParticipants\tBaseline characteristicsIntervention or exposureAge: HH head, mean, years: 48.7; \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 1 child aged 6\u00e2\u0080\u009323 months in HH, %: 41.3Place of residence: Zinder, NigerSex: female HH heads, %: 22.1Ethnicity and language: HHs belonging to the ethnic majority (Hausa), %: 90.2Occupation: NREducation: HH head with \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 1 year of primary schooling, %: 7.0SES: HH size, mean: 7.5; HH had: livestock, %: 69.1; latrine, %: 13.8; running water/closed well, %: 48.7Social capital: HH head has an official role in village, %: 21.3; borrowed food from relatives, neighbours or friends, %: 18.9Nutritional status: DDI: 7.8; HDDS: 5.2; FCS, mean: 37.6; CDS, mean: 2.2; Coping Strategy Index, mean: 7.3; reduced portion sizes for adults: 16.7; reduced portion sizes for children: 10.5; had to reduce the number of meals per day: 14.3; had entire days without eating: 6.2Morbidities: NRConcomitant or previous care: NRControlAge: HH head, mean, years: 48.3; \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 1 child aged 6\u00e2\u0080\u009323 months in HH, %: 42.9Place of residence: NRSex: female HH heads, %: 25.1Ethnicity and language: HHs belonging to the ethnic majority (Hausa), %: 89.3Occupation: NREducation: HH head with \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 1 year of primary schooling, %: 8.3SES: HH size, mean: 7.2; HH has: livestock, %: 79.1; latrine, %: 11.4; running water/closed well, %: 50.5Social capital: HH head has an official role in village, %: 26.8; borrowed food from relatives, neighbours or friends, %: 8.5Nutritional status: DDI: 8.7; HDDS: 5.6; FCS, mean: 44.4; CDS, mean: 2.4; Coping Strategy Index, mean: 3.1; reduced portion sizes for adults: 6.6; reduced portion sizes for children 3.9; had to reduce the number of meals per day: 5.9; had entire days without eating: 1.7Morbidities: NRConcomitant or previous care: NROverallAge: HH head, mean, years: 48.5; \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 1 child aged 6\u00e2\u0080\u009323 months in HH, %: 42.1Place of residence: Zinder, NigerSex: female HH heads, %: 23.6Ethnicity and language: HHs belonging to the ethnic majority (Hausa), %: 89.8Occupation: NREducation: HH head with \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 1 year of primary schooling, %: 7.6.3SES: HH size, mean: 7.4; HH has: livestock, %: 73.9; latrine, %: 10.7; running water/closed well, %: 50.3Social capital: HH head has an official role in village, %: 27.1Nutritional status: NRMorbidities: NRConcomitant or previous care: NRInclusion criteria: phase 1: HHs in 52 selected villages in the Mirrah district willing to participate in PWP.

HHs in the treatment groups were given printed vouchers entitling them to a price reduction of CNY 0.10, CNY 0.20 or CNY 0.30 off the price of each 500 g of staple good. Subsidy stayed fixed for each HH over course of study. These subsidies represented substantial price changes, since the mean preintervention price of rice in Hunan was CNY 1.2 per 500 g, and the mean for wheat flour in Gansu was CNY 1.04 per 500 g.Duration of intervention period: June\u00e2\u0080\u0093October 2006Frequency: vouchers printed in quantities of 1, 5 and 10 jin (500 g), and 1\u00e2\u0080\u0090month supply of vouchers was distributed at start of each month, with each HH receiving vouchers for 750 g per person per day (about twice the mean per capita consumption as measured by the preintervention survey). All vouchers remained valid until the end of the intervention, giving HHs time to spend down any accumulated vouchers at end of study.Number of study contacts: baseline (April 2006) with 2 follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090ups (September and December 2006)Providers: survey and intervention conducted by employees of provincial\u00e2\u0080\u0090level agencies of Chinese National Bureau of Statistics.Delivery: printed food vouchers entitling intervention HHs to the subsidy corresponding with its intervention level. Vouchers were redeemable at local grain shops, the owners of which were later reimbursed for the cost of the vouchers and given a fixed payment for complying with the guidelines in implementing the subsidy. HHs could use the vouchers only to purchase the province\u00e2\u0080\u0090specific staple good and were not permitted to resell the vouchers or the goods purchased with the vouchers (they were told there would be auditing and accounting to make sure they were in compliance with the rules, and that any violations would result in their removal from the study without any additional compensation).Co\u00e2\u0080\u0090interventions: NRResource requirements: NREconomic indicators: NRControl: no intervention\t \tOutcomes\tAdequacy of dietary intake: caloric/protein intake per capitaMineral Sufficiency index, Vitamin Sufficiency Index\t \tIdentification\tSponsorship source: National Institute of Aging, the William F.

First, provinces in which the programme had not been introduced as of October 2008 were enumerated. Of the 11 provinces available, 3 were excluded because of security concerns. From the remaining 8 provinces, 4 provinces were chosen to span all 3 macro areas of the country (North, Visayas and Mindanao). Next, in each of these 4 provinces, 2 municipalities were randomly chosen to represent the mean poverty level of areas covered by the programme. Within each selected municipality, 130 villages were randomly assigned to treatment and control groups of 65 villages each. Data for the HH assessment form to run the PMT for beneficiary selection were fielded in the 8 RCT municipalities between October 2008 and January 2009. This was followed by the implementation of Pantawid in treated villages, with the first payment of cash grants commencing in April 2009. Data used in this analysis were collected in a follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up survey from the 130 villages in October and November 2011, allowing for a programme exposure period of 30\u00e2\u0080\u009331 months.Sample size justification and outcome used: because this evaluation was a cRCT with treatment assignment at the village level, a power analysis (Supplemental Table 1) was conducted using the 3 main outcomes of interest: monthly per capita HH consumption, school participation by children aged 6\u00e2\u0080\u009314 years, and health facility visits by children aged 0\u00e2\u0080\u00935 years. In keeping with the programme's stated objective of improving child health and nutrition, the central research question of the impact evaluation was to estimate the programme effect on child health and education. However, at the time of the power calculations, data on child anthropometric measurements were N/A for the Philippinesat, a decentralised level; as a result, these outcomes were omitted from the power calculations despite their being a central concern of the impact evaluation. The 2007 Family Income and Expenditure Survey and the 2003 National Demographic Health Survey data sets were used as proxies for outcome mean and variance in the comparison population. A modest hypothesised impact ensured an adequately powered study. The power analysis used a 10% increase in HH per capita expenditures, a 7 pp increase in school enrolments in children aged 6\u00e2\u0080\u009314 years, and a 7 pp increase in health facility visit rate in children aged 0\u00e2\u0080\u00935 years. Intracluster correlation coefficients were 0.12\u00e2\u0080\u00930.25, depending on the outcome of interest. These factors combined to suggest an RCT size of 3900 HHs randomly selected from 134 enumeration clusters.Sampling method: eligible poor HHs were identified by the survey conducted by the National Household Targeting System for Poverty Reduction (NHTS\u00e2\u0080\u0090PR) that used a PMT, which estimated per capita HH income on the basis of observable and easily provided information, including HH size and physical dwelling conditions. HHs with estimated per capita income below the poverty line were classified as poor. From this subset of poor HHs, Pantawid identified eligible HHs as being those with children aged 0\u00e2\u0080\u009314 years or a pregnant woman at the time of the assessment, or both.

Farmers did their own experimentation with agroecological methods. MAFFA encourages farmers to adopt a suit of innovations rather than just a single innovation and to encourage farmer\u00e2\u0080\u0090led learning. In addition to crop diversification, many farmers increased or began to apply compost and manure to their rain\u00e2\u0080\u0090fed fields. Some farmers also experimented with botanical pesticides. MAFFA goes beyond agroecological training to focus on knowledge sharing, leadership support, nutrition and attention to social inequalities through an iterative process that integrates reflection and action, including the development of different educational activities, campaigns and training. Farmers were assisted with quality seeds, and transportation to experimental farms and community events, although farmers also incurred opportunity costs from lost farm work due to participation in these activities.Duration of intervention period: about 2 years (2012 to September 2014)Frequency: NRNumber of study contacts: 1Providers: Soils, Food and Healthy Communities organisation of Ekwendeni Hospital, Chancellor College, University of Malawi as well as Malawian and Canadian scientistsDelivery: training, educational activities, campaigns, provision of seeds.

A conservative ITT approach was taken for determining impact estimates. 6 HHs, which had identification matching problems at follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up, were dropped entirely from analysis.Randomisation ratio: 1:1. Data for the evaluation came from a HH survey of 2000 HHs with indirect relatives of Social Welfare Fund beneficiaries in the 3 targeted districts in Al Hodeidah, half of which were in communities where indirect relatives were included in the programme (treated) and half of which were in communities where they were not included (control). (Kurdi 2019 policy brief)Recruitment method: programme targeted the poorest and the most vulnerable HHs in the country by restricting recipients to Social Welfare Fund beneficiary HHs in 3 eligible districts in Al Hodeidah governorate: Marawi'ah, Bayt Al Faqiah and Zabid (Kurdi 2019, Introduction \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Program description). Beneficiaries were divided into 2 separate priority groups. Women in the pilot districts who were direct family members of Social Welfare Fund beneficiaries were in the first priority group and were automatically included in the Cash for Nutrition programme (received the intervention). Indirect family members, such as daughters\u00e2\u0080\u0090in\u00e2\u0080\u0090law, of Social Welfare Fund beneficiaries were added to a second priority list. Because the programme was not large enough to include all of these second priority women, inclusion of these indirect family member beneficiaries was randomised at the community level (Kurdi 2019, Sample and Methodology \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Randomization). The primary survey respondent was the woman identified as a second\u00e2\u0080\u0090priority potential beneficiary by the programme, which meant that all respondents were pregnant or mothers of children aged < 2 at the time of the baseline survey (Kurdi 2019, Sample and Methodology \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Survey).

Programme targeted the poorest and the most vulnerable HHs in the country by restricting recipients to Social Welfare Fund beneficiary HHs (Kurdi 2019, Introduction). Because the pilot programme was limited to 4800 beneficiaries, Social Welfare Fund beneficiaries were divided into 2 separate priority groups. Women in the pilot districts who were direct family members of Social Welfare Fund beneficiaries were in the first priority group and were automatically included in the Cash for Nutrition programme (received intervention). Indirect family members, such as daughters\u00e2\u0080\u0090in\u00e2\u0080\u0090law, of Social Welfare Fund beneficiaries were added to a second priority list. Because the programme was not large enough to include all of these second priority women, inclusion of these indirect family member beneficiaries was randomised at the community level (Kurdi 2019, Sample and methodology \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Randomization). The cRCT population consisted of the HHs of these women on the 'second priority list.'Study aim or objective: to measure the impact of the Cash for Nutrition programme on eligible HHs; to describe the degree to which HH characteristics, details of programme implementation and the external environment increased or decreased programme impact; and to describe the functioning of the programme and changes in HH welfare in the current conflict environment.Study period: December 2014 to August 2017Unit of allocation or exposure: HHs\t \tParticipants\tBaseline characteristicsCash for Nutrition InterventionAge: mother mean, years: 27.6 (SD 6.86); mother's age at marriage: mean, years: 17.6 (SD 2.94)Place of residence: NRSex: NREthnicity and language: NROccupation: NREducation: HHs with illiterate mother, %: 79.7SES: Asset Index mean \u00e2\u0080\u00930.1349 (SD 1.768); HHs owning a television, %: 33.6; HHs owning a washing machine, %: 5.9; HH owning livestock, %: 52.3; rooms in house, mean: 1.30 (SD 0.581); people in house, mean: 6.21 (SD 3.54)Social capital: HHs with husband, %: 72.9Nutritional status: mean calories consumed per adult male equivalent mean coefficient: 1820.4 (SD 1081.8); proportion of HHs without enough food in past 7 days: 0.358Morbidities: NRConcomitant or previous care: NRControlAge: mother, mean, years: 28.1 (SD 6.81); mother's age at marriage, mean, years: 17.6 (SD 2.86)Place of residence: NRSex: NREthnicity and language: NROccupation: NREducation: HHs with illiterate mother, %: 73.4SES: Asset Index mean 0.1352 (SD 1.930); HHs owning a television, %: 44.0; HHs owning a washing machine, %: 9.2; HH owning livestock, %: 52.7; rooms in house mean: 1.31 (SD 0.636); people in house mean: 6.50 (SD 3.26)Social capital: HHs with husband, %: 74.6Nutritional status: mean calories consumed per adult male equivalent mean coefficient: 1662.8 (SD 888.9); proportion of HHs without enough food in past 7 days: 0.407Morbidities: NRConcomitant or previous care: NROverall: NRInclusion criteria: for cRCT (not overall Cash for Nutrition programme): residents in 1 of the 3 targeted districts in Al Hodeidah (Marawi'ah, Bayt Al Faqiah or Zabid); mothers of children aged < 2 years and pregnant women; indirect relatives of Social Welfare Fund beneficiariesExclusion criteria: NRPretreatment: intervention HHs had a lower Asset Index mean than control HHs; fewer intervention HHs owned TVs and washing machines compared to controls; and more mothers in intervention HHs were illiterate compared to mothers in control HHs.Attrition per relevant group: at baseline, communities that included indirect relatives of Social Welfare Fund beneficiaries were randomly assigned to the intervention (95 communities, 1001 HHs) or control (95 communities, 999 HHs) groups.

Originally intended to last for 2 years, with payments of YER 3000 per month (Kurdi 2019, Introduction). The pilot programme provided CCTs to mothers of children aged < 2 years and pregnant women to motivate attendance at nutritional training sessions and compliance with health centre referrals (Kurdi 2019, Introduction). The pilot programme was suspended in late 2015 due to financing challenges related to the civil conflict in Yemen (Kurdi 2019, Introduction). The conditionality of the cash transfers was based on the attendance of the beneficiaries of the programme at nutrition\u00e2\u0080\u0090focused training sessions and compliance with child monitoring and treatment of malnutrition (Kurdi 2019, Executive summary). The monthly sessions covered topics on infant and young child feeding practices, including exclusive breastfeeding, for children aged \u00e2\u0089\u00a4 6 months, complementary feeding for children aged 6\u00e2\u0080\u009324 months, the importance of balanced meals, use of iodised salt, proper hygiene and sanitation, appropriate treatment of drinking water, and treatment of diarrhoea. Additional quarterly sessions targeted pregnant and lactating women and covered breastfeeding initiation, the importance of colostrum and no prelacteal feeds, as well as the consequences of consuming the stimulant qat (Catha edulis), smoking during pregnancy, hygiene and sanitation and treatment of drinking water. Pregnant women were also referred to the nearest health centre for antenatal care. In addition, under Yemen's Social Fund for Development, periodic screening sessions during home visits were carried out to detect and refer cases of malnutrition to health centres for treatment (Kurdi 2019, Introduction). Cash for Nutrition programme beneficiaries were required to attend these sessions and attendance was tracked, although the conditionality was not strictly enforced (Kurdi 2019, Introduction). Second part of the intervention: in the last quarter of 2017 an expanded version of the pilot programme was included in the World Bank funded Yemen Emergency Crisis Response Project.Duration of intervention period: January\u00e2\u0080\u0093December 2015; October 2016 to August 2017Frequency: quarterly transfers during January\u00e2\u0080\u0093December 2015, monthly transfers during October 2016 to August 2017, monthly nutritional training sessions from January\u00e2\u0080\u0093December 2015 and nutritional training sessions for 12 months from October 2016 to August 2017Number of study contacts: surveys completed at baseline (December 2014 to January 2015) and follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up (July\u00e2\u0080\u0093August 2017)Providers: Yemen Social Fund for Development in coordination with the Ministry of Public Health and Population, and the Yemen Emergency Crisis Response Project (funded by the World Bank)Delivery: local women with at least a high school education were selected as community health volunteers and received basic training in health and nutrition education and malnutrition screening. The volunteers were employed to provide monthly educational sessions and monitor the children of participating HHs (Kurdi 2019, Introduction). Data collection for the baseline survey was done by an independent survey organisation, Prodigy, while for the follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up survey the data collection was managed directly by the Social Fund for Development due to the challenges of conducting survey fieldwork during the conflict (Kurdi 2019, Sample and methodology \u00e2\u0080\u0093 survey).Co\u00e2\u0080\u0090interventions: unspecified other food distribution programmes.Resource requirements: transfers of YER 3000 per HH per month for January\u00e2\u0080\u0093December 2015, and YER 10,000 (about USD 30 at the time of conflict) per HH per month for October 2016 to August 2017.

Follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up survey showed that 50% of sampled HHs in the treatment areas said that they ever received PKH. This relatively low PKH coverage rate could partly explain the lack of impact. However, such coverage rates might be due to HHs not really being aware of the various poverty programme cash/subsidy they received (e.g. BLT (UCTs) vs PKH (CCTs) vs BOS (school operational assistance).Co\u00e2\u0080\u0090interventions: NRResource requirements: NREconomic indicators: NRControl characteristics: no intervention\t \tOutcomes\tAnthropometry: underweight (WAZ < \u00e2\u0080\u00932SD); severe underweight (WAZ < \u00e2\u0080\u00933SD); wasting (WHZ < \u00e2\u0080\u00932SD); severe wasting (WHZ < \u00e2\u0080\u00933SD); stunting (HAZ < \u00e2\u0080\u00932SD); severe stunting (HAZ < \u00e2\u0080\u00933SD)\t \tIdentification\tSponsorship source: research fellowship from the Harvard Kennedy School Indonesia Program.Country: IndonesiaSetting: urban very poor HHs (PKH) and rural very poor HHs (Generasi) in West Java, East Java, North Sulawesi, Gorontalo, and East Nusa Tenggara provincesAuthor's name: Dian KusumaEmail: dkusuma@mail.harvard.eduDeclarations of interest: none declared.Study or programme name and acronym: Program Keluarga Harapan (PKH) and Generasi.Type of record: journal articles\t \tNotes\t\u00c2\u00a0\t \tRisk of bias\t \tBias\tAuthors' judgement\tSupport for judgement\t \tRandom sequence generation (Selection bias)\tUnclear risk\tRandom sequence generation method NR.\t \tAllocation concealment (Selection bias)\tUnclear risk\tAllocation concealment methods NR\t \tBaseline characteristics similar (Selection bias)\tLow risk\tNo important differences between groups reported at baseline.\t \tBaseline outcome measurements similar (Selection bias)\tUnclear risk\tAlthough food consumption was similar at baseline, growth outcomes at baseline were NR\t \tBlinding of participants and personnel (Performance bias)\tLow risk\tBlinding of participants and personnel was not possible but unlikely to influence intervention received.\t \tBlinding of outcome assessment (Detection bias)\tLow risk\tUnclear whether outcome assessors were blinded but key outcomes were objective and unlikely to be influenced by lack of blinding.\t \tProtection against contamination (Performance bias)\tLow risk\tAllocation was at subdistrict level, which minimised the risk of spillovers.\t \tIncomplete outcome data (Attrition bias)\tLow risk\tNo attrition was reported.\t \tSelective outcome reporting (Reporting bias)\tUnclear risk\tProtocol N/A.\t \tOther bias\tUnclear risk\tMisclassification of exposure: low risk.

Of the eligible HHs within each municipality, 100 HHs were randomly sampled.Study aim or objective: to evaluate the impact of the FA programme on under\u00e2\u0080\u0090 and overnutrition of children as well as the BMI of women from poor HHs in Colombia.Study period: June 2002\u00e2\u0080\u00932006.Unit of allocation or exposure: municipalities\t \tParticipants\tBaseline characteristicsIntervention or exposureAge: HH head, mean, years: TCP HHs 45.44 (SE 13.13); TSP HHs: 44.15 (SE 12.95); children aged < 7 years, mean, n: TCP HHs 1.1 (SE 0.12); TSP HHs 1.25 (SE 1.19)Place of residence: lived in a rural but sparsely populated part of the municipality, mean: TCP HHs 0.47 (SE 0.5); TSP HHs 0.41 (SE 0.49); lived in a rural but populous part of the municipality: TCP HHs 0.08 (SE 0.27); TSP HHs 0.14 (SE 0.34)Sex: female adults, mean, n: TCP HHs 1.38 (SE 0.72); TSP HHs 1.36 (SE 0.7)Ethnicity and language: NROccupation: NREducation: HH head, TCP HHs, mean: incomplete primary schooling 0.48 (SE 0.50); complete primary schooling 0.15 (SE 0.35); secondary schooling 0.1 (SE 0.3); TSP HHs, mean: incomplete primary schooling 0.45 (SE 0.5); complete primary schooling 0.16 (SE 0.36); secondary schooling 0.09 (SE 0.28)SES: HH members, mean, n: TCP HHs 5.86 (SE 2.35); TSP HHs 6.12 (SE 2.41); owns a house, mean: TCP HHs 0.97 (SE 0.17); TSP HHs 0.97 (SE 0.18); subsidised health insurance, mean: TCP HHs 0.63 (SE 0.48); TSP HHs 0.7 (SE 0.46)Social capital: informally subsidised health insurance, mean: TCP HHs 0.22 (SE 0.42); TSP HHs 0.18 (SE 0.39)Nutritional status: Attanasio 2006: number of different food types consumed during the previous week, mean: TCP HHs 8.6 (SE 0.92); TSP HHs 7.8 (SE 0.14); food consumption per month, mean: TCP HHs COP 317,339.1; TSP HHs COP 301,111.6; food consumption as proportion of HH consumption per month, mean: TCP HHs 0.715, TSP HHs 0.735; all intervention HHs (Lopez\u00e2\u0080\u0090Arana 2016): HAZ, mean: \u00e2\u0080\u00931.47 (SD 1.21); stunting, n (%): 391 (30.3); BMIZ, mean: 0.20 (SD 1.0); all intervention HHs (Forde 2012): BMI of women, mean: 25.17 (95% CI 25 to 25.34)Morbidities: NRConcomitant or previous care: children participating in Hogares Comunitarios, n (%): 521/1290 (40.4)ControlAge: HH head, mean, years: 45.53 (SE 13.23); children aged < 7 years, mean, n: 1.12 (SE 1.15)Place of residence: lived in a rural but sparsely populated part of the municipality, mean: 0.35 (SE 0.48); lived in a rural but populous part of the municipality: 0.07 (SE 0.26)Sex: female adults, mean, n: 1.37 (SE 0.74)Ethnicity and language: NROccupation: NREducation: HH heads, mean: incomplete primary schooling 0.45 (SE 0.5); complete primary schooling 0.14 (SE 0.35); secondary schooling 0.09 (SE 0.29)SES: HH members, mean, n: 6.07 (SE 2.47); owns a house, mean: 0.96 (SE 0.19); subsidised health insurance, mean: 0.7 (SE 0.46)Social capital: informally subsidised health insurance, mean: 0.14 (SE 0.35)Nutritional status: Attanasio 2006: number of different food types consumed during the previous week, mean: NR; food consumption per month, mean: COP 289,527.1; food consumption as proportion of HH consumption per month, mean: 0.71; control HHs (Lopez\u00e2\u0080\u0090Arana 2016), HAZ, mean \u00e2\u0080\u00931.42 (SD 1.13); stunting, n (%): 442 (SD 27.9); BMIZ: 0.25 (0.9); control HHs (Forde 2012): BMI of women, mean: 25.43 (95% CI 25.21 to 25.65)Morbidities: NRConcomitant or previous care: children participating in Hogares Comunitarios, n (%): 897/1584 (56.6)Overall: NRInclusion criteria: families living in a municipality where the intervention (FA) was implemented were required to 1. hold a Colombian citizen card, 2. have children aged < 18 years and 3. be classified in the lowest level of the official socioeconomic classification in December 1999.Exclusion criteria: none reported for IFS report summary (Attanasio 2005) or children's study (secondary analysis) (Lopez\u00e2\u0080\u0090Arana 2016).

Control HHs were also less likely to have a mother with no education or be in an un urbanised (rural) area. In the women's study women in the treatment group were more likely to be slightly older and participate in community activities. Treatment HHs also had less persons per room, less piped water to the HH, and were less likely to be in an urban location; while control HHs had lower HH wealth. Treatment areas had larger populations, more intervention\u00e2\u0080\u0090eligible families, slightly higher average HH wealth, and many more banks; while control areas a higher quality of life index, ratio of doctors to population, and proportion of HHs with piped water.Attrition per relevant group: Attanasio 2006: attrition was 6% overall at the first follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up.

N/ARandomisation ratio: about 1:1Recruitment method: municipalities selected for their extreme levels of poverty and because they had been affected by a severe drought in previous year.Sample size justification and outcome used: NRSampling method: in communities randomly selected to participate in the Atenci\u00c3\u00b3n a Crisis programme, the primary child carer (known as the 'titular'), mainly a woman, was invited to a registration assembly where the programme objectives and various components were explained. At the end of assembly, a lottery took place in each community. Participation in the assemblies and lotteries was close to 100%. Based on lottery, all eligible HHs within each community were assigned to 1 of 3 treatments.Study aim or objective: to analyse the impact of a cash transfer programme on early childhood cognitive development and the extent to which changes in child development could be explained solely by the cash component of the Atenci\u00c3\u00b3n a Crisis programme.Study period: Atenci\u00c3\u00b3n a Crisis pilot programme was implemented between November 2005 and December 2006, Baseline data for the evaluation collected in April\u00e2\u0080\u0093May 2005. A first follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up survey collected in July\u00e2\u0080\u0093August 2006, 9 months after the HHs had started receiving payments. A second follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up survey, covering the same HHs, was collected between August 2008 and May 2009.Unit of allocation or exposure: HHs, stratified by community\t \tParticipants\tBaseline characteristicsIntervention or exposureAge: HH members aged 0\u00e2\u0080\u00935 years: 1.04; aged 5\u00e2\u0080\u009314 years: 1.7; aged 15\u00e2\u0080\u009324 years: 1.17; aged 24\u00e2\u0080\u009364 years: 1.84; aged > 65 years: 0.13Place of residence: number of rooms in the house: 1.57Sex: female children. %: 50; male HH head, %: 85Ethnicity and language: NROccupation: NREducation: number of years of education: mother 4.05; father 3.81SES: NRSocial capital: NRNutritional status: children aged 0\u00e2\u0080\u00935 years: WAZ \u00e2\u0080\u00931.06; HAZ \u00e2\u0080\u00931.27; WHZ \u00e2\u0080\u00930.18Morbidities: NRConcomitant or previous care: NRControlAge: HH members aged 0\u00e2\u0080\u00935 years: 1.06; aged 5\u00e2\u0080\u009314 years: 1.69; aged 15\u00e2\u0080\u009324 years: 1.21; aged 24\u00e2\u0080\u009364 years: 1.88; aged > 65 years: 0.18Place of residence: rural community in NicaraguaSex: NREthnicity and language: NROccupation: NREducation: number of years of education: mother 4.21; father 3.88SES: NRSocial capital: NRNutritional status: children aged 0\u00e2\u0080\u00935: WAZ \u00e2\u0080\u00930.88; HAZ \u00e2\u0080\u00931.08; WHZ \u00e2\u0080\u00930.16Morbidities: NRConcomitant or previous care: NROverall: NRInclusion criteria: baseline data on HH assets and HH composition were then used to define programme eligibility. The eligibility criteria were determined using the proxy means methodology developed for the RPS and based on the national HH data from 2001 (EMNV). Additional discussions with local leaders from each intervention community were conducted to identify possible exclusion or inclusion errors. Based on the discussions with leaders, 3.7% of all the HHs considered were re\u00e2\u0080\u0090assigned from non\u00e2\u0080\u0090eligible to eligible, and 3.7% from eligible to non\u00e2\u0080\u0090eligible. To avoid any possible selection bias resulting from the re\u00e2\u0080\u0090assignment by the leaders, the results they presented use eligibility by the proxy means as the ITT (without taking into account the reclassification by the community leaders).Exclusion criteria: NRPretreatment: children aged 0\u00e2\u0080\u00935 years in the intervention group at baseline were significantly more underweight and received fewer vitamins and deworming drugs in the previous 6 months when compared to those in the control group. Also, in the control compared to the intervention group, HHs had more members aged \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 65 years.Attrition per relevant group: attrition over the study period was minimal, < 1.3% in 2006 and 2.4% in 2008. Attrition is uncorrelated with treatment status, and does not differ across treatment packages. The low attrition rates were a result of repeat visits to recover temporary absence and extensive tracking of migrants. Migrant HHs and children were interviewed and tested in their new locations.Description of subgroups measured and reported: NRTotal number completed and analysed per relevant group: overall: 3326 in 2006 and 4245 in 2008.

First, to serve as a short\u00e2\u0080\u0090term safety net by providing cash transfers to reduce the need for adverse coping mechanisms, such as taking children out of school or reductions in food consumption. Second, to promote long\u00e2\u0080\u0090term upward mobility and poverty reduction by enhancing HHs' asset base and income diversification capacity. There were 3 different intervention groups, all received the same cash transfers (the same amount paid to the child's primary carer every 2 months), but with differing conditionalities or other co\u00e2\u0080\u0090interventions. Group 1: the conditionality of regular health check\u00e2\u0080\u0090ups for children aged 0\u00e2\u0080\u00935 years was not monitored, and thus HHs were not penalised if they did not comply. Group 2: 1 member per HH was offered a scholarship to choose out of a number of vocational training courses at the municipal headquarters. Group 3: HHs were offered a lump sum payment to start a small non\u00e2\u0080\u0090agricultural activity; the lump sum was conditional on developing a business development plan.Duration of intervention period: Atenci\u00c3\u00b3n a Crisis pilot programme was implemented between November 2005 and December 2006.Frequency: bi\u00e2\u0080\u0090monthly cash transfersNumber of study contacts: 3; baseline, first follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up, second follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090upProviders: Ministry of the Family and programme staffDelivery: cash transfers paid every 2 months.

Maluccio 2005 Study characteristics\t \tMethods\tStudy design: cRCTStudy grouping: parallel groupHow were missing data handled? 90% (1581) of the stratified random sample was interviewed in the first round. In 2002, just over 90% of these were re\u00e2\u0080\u0090interviewed. The sample for which there is a complete set of observations (1 in each of the 3 survey rounds) was 1396, smaller than the 1434 shown in the first row of the third column of Table 3. The HHs were about evenly divided between intervention and control groups, indicating that at least the level of attrition was not significantly different between them. Similarly, when the sample was limited to those interviewed in all 3 rounds as a partial control for attrition bias, estimated effects changed only slightly, with no systematic bias. Another partial remedy to control for attrition bias is to estimate a HH fixed\u00e2\u0080\u0090effects model, particularly if one suspects that unobserved persistent heterogeneity is leading to attrition. However, as with the other robustness checks, when the models were estimated with these controls, the results differed little. The number of HHs was about evenly divided between intervention and control groups, suggesting that attrition was not significantly different between groups. Combining this with the evidence from the robustness checks just described, it was concluded that attrition bias was not driving the results presented.Randomisation ratio: 1:1Recruitment method: NRSample size justification and outcome used: 42 HHs were randomly selected in each comarca using a census carried out by RPS 3 months prior to the survey as the sample frame, yielding an initial target sample of 1764 HHs. The sample size calculation was based on assessing the necessary sample sizes for the indicators listed in Appendix B, Table 26. Assuming a random sample, the indicator that required the largest sample size, using a significance level of 5% and a power of 80%, was enrolment for Grades 1\u00e2\u0080\u00934 (indicator 5 in Appendix B, Table 26). To detect a minimum, statistically significant difference of 8 pps between intervention and control groups, a sample size of 549 students for each group was required. Not all HHs had children in this age group. According to the 2000 RPS population census, 63% of HHs had \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 1 child aged 6\u00e2\u0080\u009312 years. Therefore, to obtain a sample of 549 children (in different HHs), it was necessary to interview 871 HHs in each group (549 divided by 0.63) or 1742 in total. Thus, the study authors arrived at a target sample of 1764 HHs.Sampling method: in the design phase of RPS, rural areas in all 17 departments of Nicaragua were eligible for the programme. In addition, these departments had easy physical access and communication (including being < 1\u00e2\u0080\u0090day drive from the capital, Managua, where RPS is headquartered), relatively strong institutional capacity and local co\u00e2\u0080\u0090ordination, and reasonably good coverage of health posts and schools. By purposively targeting, RPS avoided devoting a disproportionate share of its resources during the pilot to increasing the supply of educational and health services. In the next stage of geographic targeting, all 6 (out of 20) municipalities that had the participatory development programme Microplanificaci\u00c3\u00b3n Participativa (Participatory Micro\u00e2\u0080\u0090planning), run by the national Fondo de Inversi\u00c3\u00b3n Social de Emergencia (FISE), were chosen. In the last stage of geographic targeting, a marginality index based on information from the 1995 National Population and Housing Census was constructed, and an index score was calculated for all 59 rural census comarcas2 in the selected municipalities. The index was a weighted mean of the following set of poverty indicators (with respective weights in parentheses) known to be highly associated with poverty (Arcia 1999): 1. family size (10%), 2. access to potable water (50%), 3. access to latrines (30%), and 4. illiteracy rates (10%). Higher index scores were associated with more impoverished areas. Recognising that the index could not reliably distinguish between 2 comarcas with similar scores, rather than use the scores directly, the 59 rural comarcas were grouped into 4 priority levels after renormalising the highest index score to 100: a score > 85 was given highest priority (priority 1); 70\u00e2\u0080\u009385, priority 2; 60\u00e2\u0080\u009370, priority 3 and below 60, lowest priority. The 42 comarcas with the priority scores 1 and 2 were eligible for the pilot phase's first stage. Comarcas are administrative areas within municipalities that include 1\u00e2\u0080\u00935 small communities averaging 100 HHs each.Study aim or objective: to determine the impact evaluation of a randomised community\u00e2\u0080\u0090based intervention, RPS, against a broad range of outcomes related to the programme's primary objectives, including 1. HH (food) expenditures, 2. child schooling and child labour, 3. preventive health care of children aged < 5 years, and 4. nutritional status of children.Study period: baseline: 2000; follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up: 2001\u00e2\u0080\u00932002Unit of allocation or exposure: randomisation was at the comarca level.

The goal of that programme was to develop the capacity of municipal governments to select, implement and monitor social infrastructure projects such as school and health post construction, with an emphasis on local participation.Inclusion criteria: in the design phase of RPS, rural areas in all 17 departments of Nicaragua were eligible for the programme. The focus on rural areas reflects the distribution of poverty in Nicaragua of the 48% of Nicaraguans designated as poor in 1998, 75% resided in rural areas. For the pilot, the Government of Nicaragua selected the departments of Madriz and Matagalpa from the northern part of the Central Region, on the basis of poverty as well as on their capacity to implement the programme. Table 1 of the publication summarises the eligibility requirements and demand and supply\u00e2\u0080\u0090side benefits of RPS.Exclusion criteria: HH not extremely poor satisfying 1 or both of the following: 1. own a vehicle, truck, pickup truck or jeep; 2. own > 20 manzanas (14.1 hectares) of land. Based on these criteria, 169 HHs (2.9% of HHs living in the intervention areas as reported in the May 2000 RPS census population) were excluded from the programme. In addition to these HHs, 219 (3.8%) HHs were excluded after the orientation assemblies and programme registration for \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 1 of the following reasons: 1. HH comprising a single man or woman who was not disabled, 2. HH with significant economic resources or a business, 3. HH that omitted or falsified information during the RPS population census. Finally, 240 (4.2%) HHs did not attend the orientation assembly or chose not to participate.Pretreatment: there were few significant differences between HHs (or individuals) in intervention and control groups at baseline. Differences in baseline 2000 study: RPS mean effect on annual total HH: intervention: NIO 20,903 control; NIO 20,695 in controlAttrition per relevant group: 90% (1581) of the stratified random sample was interviewed in the first round (see Table 3 of publication). In a few comarcas, the coverage was 100%, but in 6, it was < 80%. For the follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up surveys in October 2001 and October 2002, the target sample was limited to these 1581 first\u00e2\u0080\u0090round interviews. In 2002, just over 90% of these were re\u00e2\u0080\u0090interviewed, on a par with surveys of similar magnitude in other developing countries. Again, however, coverage in 6 of the comarcas was substantially worse, with < 80% successfully re\u00e2\u0080\u0090interviewed (and 1 was 1 of the 6 from above with high first\u00e2\u0080\u0090round non\u00e2\u0080\u0090response rate). This attrition was unlikely to have been random.Description of subgroups measured and reported: Grades 1, 2, 3 and 4; extreme poor, poor and non\u00e2\u0080\u0090poor; children aged 0\u00e2\u0080\u00933 years, 12\u00e2\u0080\u009323 months; HHs with children aged 0\u00e2\u0080\u00935 years; HHs with children aged 7\u00e2\u0080\u009313 years;Total number completed and analysed per relevant group: total completed interview: 1581 in 2000, 1490 in 2001 and 1434 in 2002. Total completed interview in all 3 rounds: 1396.Total number enrolled per relevant group: total enrolled: 1764 in 2000, 1581 in 2001 and 1581 in 2002.Total number randomised per relevant group: evaluation design was based on a randomised, community\u00e2\u0080\u0090based intervention with measurements before and after the intervention in both treatment and control communities. One\u00e2\u0080\u0090half of the 42 comarcas (targeted in the first stage) were randomly selected into the programme. Thus, there are 21 comarcas in the intervention group and 21 in the control group.\t \tInterventions\tIntervention characteristicsIntervention or exposureFood access intervention category: increase buying powerIntervention type: CCTDescription: modelled after PROGRESA, RPS is designed to address both current and future poverty via cash transfers targeted to HHs living in poverty in rural Nicaragua. The transfers were conditional, and HHs were monitored to ensure that children were, among other things, attending school and making visits to preventive healthcare providers. RPSs specific objectives included: supplementing HH income for up to 3 years to increase expenditures on food, reducing school desertion during the first 4 years of primary school, and increasing the health care and nutritional status of children aged < 5 years.Duration of intervention period: 2 yearsFrequency: every other monthNumber of study contacts: 3 (baseline, follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up 2001 and follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up 2002)Providers: IADB loan financing the project and the Government of Nicaragua and RPS provided the service. IFPRI conducted the quantitative impact evaluationDelivery: to ensure adequate supply, RPS trained and paid private providers to deliver the specific healthcare services required by the programme. Cash transfer delivery method NR.Co\u00e2\u0080\u0090interventions: none reportedResource requirements: to ensure adequate supply, RPS trained and paid private providers to deliver the specific healthcare services required by the programme. These services provided free of charge to beneficiary HHs, included growth and development monitoring; vaccination; and provision of antiparasites, vitamins, and iron supplements. The monitoring was done using the MIS designed specifically for and by RPS. It comprises a continuously updated, relational database of beneficiaries, healthcare providers and schools. The MIS is also used to 1. select beneficiaries and prepare invitations to programme incorporation assemblies, 2. calculate transfer payments, 3. compile requests to the Ministry of Health for vaccines and other materials, and 4. monitor whether service providers were meeting their responsibilities. Decision rules capturing the requirements were programmed directly into the MIS. Substantial time was dedicated to designing data forms for the various programme participants that fed into this system (including the HH registry or census forms, school forms, and healthcare provider forms that were all sent to the main office where they were entered into the computer).Economic indicators: RPS comprised 2 phases over 5 years, starting in 2000. The pilot phase (also known as Phase I) lasted 3 years and had a budget of USD 11 million, representing approximately 0.2% of GDP or 2% of annual recurring government spending on health and education. The value of the supply\u00e2\u0080\u0090side services, as measured by how much RPS paid to the providers, was also substantial. On an annual basis, the education workshops cost approximately USD 50 per beneficiary and the health services for children aged < 5 years, approximately USD 110, including the value of the vaccines, antiparasites, vitamins and iron supplements, all of which were provided by the Ministry of Health. To enforce compliance with programme requirements, beneficiaries did not receive the food or education component of the transfer if they failed to carry out any of the conditions.Control: no intervention\t \tOutcomes\tProportion of HH expenditure on food: per capita food expenditure (annual); percentage of HH food expenditure; food expenditure for different food groups/itemsAnthropometry: underweight (WAZ < \u00e2\u0080\u00932SD); stunted (HAZ < 2SD); wasted (WHZ < \u00e2\u0080\u00932SD); HAZ\t \tIdentification\tSponsorship source: IFPRICountry: NicaraguaSetting: 42 rural comarcas areas in rural departments of Madriz and Matagalpa in the northern part of the Central Region in NicaraguaAuthors' names: John A Maluccio and Rafael FloresEmail: NRDeclarations of interest: NRStudy or programme name and acronym: Red de Protecci\u00c3\u00b3n Social (RPS) or 'Social Safety Net'Type of record: report\t \tNotes\t\u00c2\u00a0\t \tRisk of bias\t \tBias\tAuthors' judgement\tSupport for judgement\t \tRandom sequence generation (Selection bias)\tLow risk\tRandomisation done through lottery process. Given the geography of the programme area, control and intervention comarcas were at times adjacent to one another. The selection was done at a public event with representatives from the comarcas, the Government of Nicaragua, IADB, IFPRI and the media present. The 42 comarcas were ordered by their marginality index scores and stratified into 7 groups of 6 each. Within each stratum, randomisation was achieved by blindly drawing 1 of 6 coloured balls (3 blue for intervention, 3 white for control) from a box after the name of each comarca was called out. Thus, 3 comarcas from each group were randomly selected for inclusion in the programme, while the other 3 were selected as controls. The survey sample is a stratified random\u00e2\u0080\u0090sample at the comarca level from all 42 comarcas. The areas represented comprise a relatively poor part of the rural Central Region in Nicaragua, but the sample is not statistically representative of the 6 municipalities (or other areas of Nicaragua, for that matter). 42 HHs were randomly selected in each comarca using a census carried out by RPS 3 months prior to the survey as the sample frame, yielding an initial target sample of 1764 HHs.\t \tAllocation concealment (Selection bias)\tLow risk\tAllocation was at the comarca level at the beginning of the study.

A HH may be a beneficiary while its neighbour is a non\u00e2\u0080\u0090beneficiary, particularly in a few cases where boundaries such as roads divide 2 comarcas. Seeing the activity and the emphasis placed on the RPS objectives may lead non\u00e2\u0080\u0090beneficiaries to undertake behaviour they would not have otherwise.\t \tIncomplete outcome data (Attrition bias)\tLow risk\tQuote: \"We now document non\u00e2\u0080\u0090response in the 2000 baseline survey and attrition in the follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up surveys.

ITT analysisRandomisation ratio: 1:1Recruitment method: 6 Upper Manya Krobo District subdistricts stratified by population size, 3 subdistricts randomly selected as study site, census of communities completed with GPS location of all HHs, 89 communities organised geographically into 16 clusters, within each cluster, communities randomly chosen to reach target number of eligible HHs per cluster, 39 communities selected as study area. Enrolment and intervention implementation carried out in 2 phases: Phase 1 (2014\u00e2\u0080\u00932015): all women with infants who lived in selected communities and planned to remain community for duration of project invited to enrol. Phase 2 (2016\u00e2\u0080\u00932017): age range expanded to target young children < 18 months to include planned sample size \u00e2\u0080\u0093 both phases included additional eligibility criteria. All 277 eligible HHs in selected communities of 8 intervention clusters invited to enrol in Phase 1 (2014). At end of Phase 1, new 95 eligible HHs from same communities identified and invited to enrol in Phase 2 (2016). 2 intervention clusters had no new eligible HHs so 6 intervention clusters were active in Phase 2. 34 eligible HHs were not enrolled, 51 were enrolled, baseline data lost due to malfunction. Control cluster communities with no benefit not enrolled a second time and order of including control clusters randomly assigned. To mimic intervention enrolment, 5 control clusters were used in Phase 1 (135 eligible HHs) and 3 control clusters (114 eligible HHs) in Phase 2. Among control clusters, 36 HHs were not enrolled.Sample size justification and outcome used: sample size calculated with an \u00ce\u00b1 = 0.05, power = 0.80, effect size d = 0.35, and variance inflation factor = 1.79, resulting in 227 HHs/group. Assuming an LTFU of 10%, the sample size estimate was 250 per treatment group or a total of 500 mother\u00e2\u0080\u0093child pairs. Outcome not mentioned.Sampling method: random as communities within clusters were randomly chosen.Study aim or objective: to determine the effect of a 12\u00e2\u0080\u0090month intervention (inputs and training for poultry farming and home gardening, and nutrition and health education) on child diet and nutritional status.Study period: phase 1: 12 months; phase 2: 12 monthsUnit of allocation or exposure: clusters consisting of either 1 distinct community or multiple adjacent small communities.\t \tParticipants\tBaseline characteristicsIntervention or exposureAge: child, mean, months: 10.52 (SD 5.17)Place of residence: NRSex: female children, n (%): 143 (49.8)Ethnicity and language, n (%): mothers of Krobo ethnicity: 217 (76.4); mothers of other ethnicity: 67 (23.6)Occupation: NREducation, n (%): no education 54 (24.5); primary education 100 (45.5); secondary education 66 (30.0)SES, n (%): low HH wealth 92 (33.0); middle HH wealth 95 (34.0); high HH wealth 92 (33.0); raised poultry in past 12 months 140 (48.8)Social capital: NRNutritional status: mean: LAZ: \u00e2\u0080\u00930.88 (SD 1.27); WAZ: \u00e2\u0080\u00930.78 (SD 1.12); WLZ: \u00e2\u0080\u00930.37 (SD 1.08); consumed eggs in previous 24 hours, n (%): 56 (25.3); minimal diverse diet, n (%): 67 (30.9); food secure, n (%): 123 (43.3); mild food insecurity, n (%): 79 (27.8); moderate food insecurity, n (%): 48 (16.9); severe food insecurity, n (%): 34 (12.0)Morbidities: NRConcomitant or previous care: NRControlAge: child mean, months: 10.43 (SD 5.07)Place of residence: NRSex: child female, n (%): 97 (45.5)Ethnicity and language, n (%): mothers of Krobo ethnicity: 161 (77.4); mothers of other ethnicity: 47 (22.6)Occupation: NREducation, n (%): no education 40 (29.2); primary education 89 (42.8); secondary education 79 (38.0)SES, n (%): low HH wealth 70 (33.8); middle HH wealth 67 (32.4); high HH wealth 70 (33.8); raised poultry in past 12 months 114 (53.5)Social capital: NRNutritional status: mean: LAZ: \u00e2\u0080\u00930.78 (SD 1.30); WAZ: \u00e2\u0080\u00930.68 (SD 1.27); WLZ: \u00e2\u0080\u00930.31 (SD 1.24); consumed eggs in previous 24 hours, n (%): 35 (21.5); minimal diverse diet, n (%): 54 (33.8); food secure, n (%): 95 (45.2); mild food insecurity, n (%): 54 (25.7); moderate food insecurity, n (%): 39 (18.6); severe food insecurity, n (%): 22 (10.5)Morbidities: NRConcomitant or previous care: NROverall: NRInclusion criteria: in Phase 1 (2014\u00e2\u0080\u00932015), all women with infants (aged 0\u00e2\u0080\u009312 months) who lived in the selected communities and who planned to remain in the community for the duration of the project were invited to enrol in the trial. In Phase 2 (2016\u00e2\u0080\u00932017), the age range was expanded to target young children aged < 18 months to include the planned sample size. For both phases, additional eligibility criteria for the intervention participants included the timely preparation of a chicken coop that met project specifications and a fenced home garden plot.Exclusion criteria: NRPretreatment: rate for enrolment with baseline completion was lower among the intervention compared with the control clusters, partly due to a malfunction of the electronic data collection system (77.2% intervention vs 83.5% control; P < 0.01).

There were no baseline treatment group differences in child, maternal or HH characteristicsAttrition per relevant group: total 14.4%. Total LTFU cases were due to refusal (2), participant moved outside study area (49), and maternal or child death (5). The remaining cases could not be found (16).

Beekeeping was introduced for interested HHs only in Phase 1 for honey harvesting after end of trial. The intervention had 4 main components. 1. Poultry for egg production. Participants received 4 days of intensive training from livestock extension and veterinary officers on a wide variety of topics to build their knowledge and skills in poultry farming. These included 2 days on coop construction using local materials and 2 days on feeding and caring of poultry. During Phase 1, each participant received 40 Swiss Brown chickens at point of lay. The Heifer's POG funds supported the purchase of 30 chickens for each Phase 2 participant. To compensate for the lower number of chickens provided so that women in Phase 2 would have similar income to Phase 1, the POG repayment requirement was reduced by 50%. To assist women with their poultry\u00e2\u0080\u0090based small business, the project facilitated egg sales for women who could not access markets. 2. Home gardens. Project agricultural staff trained participants at the University of Ghana's Nutrition Research and Training Centre and in the communities on vegetable gardening, providing information on site selection, fencing, seedbed preparation, compost preparation and use, and organic weed, insect, and pest control. 3. Group education. Weekly group education sessions were carried out using a curriculum of 12 lessons that was repeated during the year. The lessons emphasised young child diet and health, with special emphasis on diet diversity and consumption of eggs, green leafy vegetables and orange\u00e2\u0080\u0090fleshed sweet potatoes. 4. Community\u00e2\u0080\u0090wide education. The intervention communities received training that was accessible to all residents. The training included a. food demonstration sessions that emphasised the consumption of vegetables promoted for home gardens and eggs, b. mother\u00e2\u0080\u0090to\u00e2\u0080\u0090mother support groups that encouraged optimal child\u00e2\u0080\u0090feeding practices, c. enhanced community\u00e2\u0080\u0090based growth monitoring and promotion, and d. community\u00e2\u0080\u0090wide discussions on gender and diversity.

However, we did not detect any baseline differences by treatment group, and the sensitivity analysis results were consistent with the ITT analysis, suggesting that selection bias was not large enough to affect the results.\" Merttens 2013 Study characteristics\t \tMethods\tStudy design: cRCTStudy grouping: parallel groupHow were missing data handled? (quote) \"Column 8 shows the number of observations at follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up (FU1) which is 2,867 (the sample of households comprising the treatment plus control panel) minus any missing values.\" Therefore, where there were missing data, the sample size for that outcome was reduced accordingly. Probability of retention was estimated using regression, and weighting of HHs was adjusted by inverse retention probability to adequately represent attrition HHs.Randomisation ratio: 1:1Recruitment method: evaluation covered the 4 former districts of Mandera, Marsabit, Turkana and Wajir, in 12 randomly selected sublocations in each district. The sublocations that were covered by the evaluation were referred to as the evaluation sublocations. The HSNP applied a staggered roll\u00e2\u0080\u0090out, with sublocations being brought into the Programme on a month\u00e2\u0080\u0090by\u00e2\u0080\u0090month basis.Sample size justification and outcome used: calculated based on the expected sampling error for point estimates, differences and DID for key indicators. These key indicators were not explicitly reported. A sample attrition buffer of 10% was factored in to compensate for the high risk of sample attrition.Sampling method: intervention and control HHs were sampled from HSNP administrative records. From these, 66 HHs were sampled from each sublocation using simple random sampling. In the event of non\u00e2\u0080\u0090response, a replacement HH which had not yet been drawn was randomly selected from the administrative record. The sequence in which the sampled evaluation sublocations were targeted and surveyed was determined randomly. The evaluation sublocations were selected from a sample frame of all secure sublocations in each district. The evaluation sublocations were sorted within new districts by population density and paired up, with 1 of the pair being control and 1 being treatment. The reason sublocations were sorted (within each new district) by population density before pairing them up was to ensure that similar sublocations were matched to reduce as far as possible significant variations between the characteristics of the control and treatment groups. For both the treatment and control sublocations there were an equal number of CBT, SP and DR sublocations.Study aim or objective: to evaluate the HSNP programme's impact on consumption expenditure and poverty reduction, food security, and increased asset retention and accumulation. Secondary impacts namely uptake of health and education services, stabilised food prices, supplies of key commodities, diversity of livelihood activities, financial savings, vulnerability to shocks, empowerment of women, and well\u00e2\u0080\u0090being of the young and elderly people were also assessed.Study period: August 2009 to November 2012Unit of allocation or exposure: sublocations (geographical areas within counties)\t \tParticipants\tBaseline characteristicsIntervention or exposureAge: HHs containing \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 1 child aged < 18 years, %: 91.9;

Higher proportions of intervention HHs were receiving food aid when compared to control HHs, and a lower proportion of intervention HHs had children aged < 5 years with moderate stunting. A lower proportion of intervention HHs reported having skipped eating for entire days in the past 30 days. School attendance for all ages and both sexes was higher in intervention HHs. Significantly more control HHs owned livestock when compared to intervention HHs.Attrition per relevant group: follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up (November 2011): 9% (137/1571) for intervention and 7% (103/1536) for control HHs.

The value of the transfer was determined as 75% of the WFP food aid ration in 2006 (when the value was determined). Some HHs had multiple nominated beneficiaries; the effective value of the transfer per HH member was smaller for larger HHs.Duration of intervention period: 2 years (November 2010 to November 2012)Frequency: every 2 monthsNumber of study contacts: impact evaluation data collected over 3 rounds comprising a baseline round (August 2009 to November 2010), follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up 1 round (November 2010 to November 2011), and follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up 2 round (February 2012 to November 2012).Providers: operated under the Ministry of State for the Development of Northern Kenya and Other Arid Lands and was delivered by several contracted service providers.Delivery: cash was loaded onto a biometric smart card that could be used to collect the cash transfer from a range of pay points (usually small shops).Co\u00e2\u0080\u0090interventions: NRResource requirements: NREconomic indicators: for two\u00e2\u0080\u0090thirds of beneficiary HHs the transfer had a per capita value of KES 350\u00e2\u0080\u0093700.ControlFood access intervention category: delayed\u00e2\u0080\u0090intervention (waiting list) control (non\u00e2\u0080\u0090active control at the time of data collection)Intervention type: N/ADescription: control HHs only began to receive cash upon completion of the final round of data collection (follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up 2 survey), i.e. 2 years after the baseline survey.Duration of intervention period: N/AFrequency: N/ANumber of study contacts: baseline data collection (November 2010) and 2 follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up interviews (November 2011 and 2012)Providers: N/ADelivery: N/ACo\u00e2\u0080\u0090interventions: NRResource requirements: NREconomic indicators: NR\t \tOutcomes\tProportion of HH expenditure on food: proportion of consumption expenditure spent on food; monthly food consumption expenditure per AEFood security: proportion of HHs food insecure in worst recent food shortage periodDietary diversity: HDDS (0\u00e2\u0080\u009312)Anthropometry: moderate and severe wasting; moderate and severe stunting; moderate and severe underweightMorbidity: proportion of people ill/injured in previous 3 months\t \tIdentification\tSponsorship source: DfID.Country: KenyaSetting: impoverished rural HHsAuthor's name: Fred MerttensEmail: fred.merttens@opml.co.uk; admin@opml.co.ukDeclarations of interest: NRStudy or programme name and acronym: Hunger Safety Net Programme (HSNP)Type of record: impact evaluation report\t \tNotes\t\u00c2\u00a0\t \tRisk of bias\t \tBias\tAuthors' judgement\tSupport for judgement\t \tRandom sequence generation (Selection bias)\tLow risk\tQuote: \"Forty\u00e2\u0080\u0090eight programme sub\u00e2\u0080\u0090locations were then randomly selected from the pool of all programme sub\u00e2\u0080\u0090locations and then from those each pair were randomly assigned between treatment and control at a public lottery event (bahati na sibu) facilitated by the HSNP Secretariat and attended by officials from the district and the two sub\u00e2\u0080\u0090locations in question.\"\t \tAllocation concealment (Selection bias)\tLow risk\tThe unit of allocation was 'sublocations', stratified by district.

Farmers were provided with 3 years of continuous training and extension support to enable them to become efficient in utilising inputs such as labour, organic fertiliser and capital. The project tested the adoption of integrated aquaculture\u00e2\u0080\u0090agriculture under 2 different models: 1 with the provision of a small financial grant (which was provided for purchasing inputs especially fish seed but also other inputs), and 1 without. The project aimed at improving resource\u00e2\u0080\u0090use efficiency to increase farm\u00e2\u0080\u0090level productivity in a sustainable manner through diffusion of low\u00e2\u0080\u0090cost integrated aquaculture\u00e2\u0080\u0090agriculture approaches suitable for poor farmers with limited resources. Long\u00e2\u0080\u0090term training and close extension support were provided to the project farmers. These farmers received 3 training sessions during the first year, 2 during the second year, and 1 follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up training in the final year. Formal training was complemented by regular informal training sessions, such as group meetings at the pond/plot site using the Participatory Adaptive Learning approach (PAL), and annual participatory evaluation sessions. Under the PAL approach community members and field staff learn together while going through the process.Duration of intervention period: 3 years; 2002/2003 to 2005/2006Frequency: 3 training sessions during the first year, 2 during the second year, and 1 follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up training in the final year.

Trained field workers explained the study to eligible HHs, and informed consent was obtained from either the HH head or the mother of the selected child.Sample size justification and outcome used: the study was restricted to 55 villages that met minimum programme eligibility criteria in the 4 departments because of logistics and cost. We estimated a sample size of 30 children per cluster with statistical significance of 0.05, power of 0.80 and an intracluster correlation of 0.02. This sample size provided the ability to detect minimum differences between treatment groups of a change of 0.25 in mean HAZ and WHZ and a 0.3 g/dL change in Hb. The sample also permitted the estimation of changes of 10 pps in the prevalence of wasting, anaemia and diarrhoea and 15 pp in stunting.\"Sampling method: before the baseline evaluation, villages within 4 'departments' in the province of Gourma were identified for possible inclusion in the EHFP programme; participating villages needed to have water sources to support production during the dry season. 55/181 eligible villages were identified for randomisation and were stratified by commune/department and village size before randomisation into 1 of 3 groups: 1. control group, which received no interventions from HKI (25 control villages), 2. EHFP programme with BCC led by OWLs (15 OWL villages \u00e2\u0080\u0093 nutrition and health education done by OWLs), or 3.

Set of agricultural production and nutrition interventions targeted to mothers with children aged 3\u00e2\u0080\u009312 months at baseline. Agricultural production interventions centred on dedicating land to women's production during the secondary agricultural season and distributing inputs and training to increase production and consumption of nutrient\u00e2\u0080\u0090rich foods and to generate additional income (and control over that income) through the sale of surplus production. Programme beneficiaries were provided with saplings, cuttings and seeds of nutrient\u00e2\u0080\u0090rich fruits (e.g. mangoes and papayas) and vegetables (e.g. orange\u00e2\u0080\u0090flesh sweet potatoes, dark green leafy vegetables and carrots) and small gardening tools (e.g. hoes, shovels and watering cans). Beneficiaries were also given chicks to increase production of animal source foods (i.e. eggs and meat from the chickens). In addition, they received training in optimal agriculture and poultry\u00e2\u0080\u0090raising practices to help them establish their homestead food production activities. Nutrition intervention: used a BCC strategy known as the Essential Nutrition Actions framework, which focuses on 7 primary health and nutrition behaviours. Twice a month, all beneficiary mothers were visited in groups or individually by 1 of 2 different types of community volunteers trained by the programme; either OWLs or HC members. This component aimed to improve mothers' own health and nutrition by enabling them to adopt optimal health and nutrition practices for themselves and their young children.Duration of intervention period: NRFrequency: frequency of distribution of productive assets and training regarding agricultural intervention NR.

Under the guidance of HKI, this woman then trained 20 other beneficiary women on how to establish their home gardens and poultry production (Osei 2017).Sample size justification and outcome used: calculated to detect an assumed difference in the prevalence of stunting and underweight of 10% as well as a difference in wasting of 5% among children in the treatment compared to the control communities. Using a power of 0.80, a 95% CI (2 sided), an assumed design effect of 2 and an upward adjustment of 10% to account for LTFU, 1970 children were considered adequate for each of the pre\u00e2\u0080\u0090 and post\u00e2\u0080\u0090treatment surveys. The baseline sample was increased to 2106 to allow enough participants for a substudy, which involved providing micronutrient powders to a subsample of 110 children in the intervention communities for 6 months. The follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up sample was also increased to 2614 to allow sufficient participants for disaggregated analysis (Osei 2017)Sampling method: multistage cRCT. The Baitadi district is administratively divided into 12 subdistricts called 'Ilakas', and each 'Ilaka' is further divided into 'village development committees' (VDCs), which consist of several (about 9) villages. (Osei 2015). Assigned Ilakas (instead of villages or HHs) into each of the 2 study groups. Ilakas were paired on several key socioeconomic indicators, and 4 of the generated 6 pairs of Ilakas were selected for inclusion in study using a simple random sampling procedure. The same procedure was followed to assign 1 Ilaka in each pair as the treatment group and the other as the control. Overall, there were 21 VDCs in the treatment Ilaka and 20 in the control Ilakas (Osei 2017). All the VDCs in the EHFP programme communities received the EHFP intervention. To select families for the pre\u00e2\u0080\u0090 and postsurveys, VDCs were stratified by treatment (21) or control group (20), and 14 VDCs were selected from each using a simple random sampling procedure to participate in the surveys. However, all the VDCs in the EHFP programme communities received the EHFP intervention, regardless of their participation in the surveys. Within each selected VDC, HHs were selected using the probability proportional to size technique, and in each selected HH, a child aged 12\u00e2\u0080\u009348 months was chosen together with his/her mother for the assessments. If a HH had > 1 eligible child, the youngest child was chosen (Osei 2017).Study aim or objective: to determine the effect of an EHFP programme consisting of home garden, poultry raising and nutrition education implemented over 2.5 years vs control (no intervention) on anthropometry and anaemia among children (aged 12\u00e2\u0080\u009348 months) and their mothers (Osei 2017).Study period: 2.5 years from 2009 to 2012.

Children in the intervention group were significantly older than those in the control group at follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up. Other characteristics that were similar among the study groups at baseline but differed significantly at follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up included the proportion of HHs with no monthly cash income and those with some financial debts at the time of the surveys. Both surveys showed significantly fewer mothers with no formal education, mothers who worked outside the home, and proportion of families with married HH heads, in the upper caste and lower tercile of wealth among the treatment compared to the control group.Attrition per relevant group: attrition not relevant as baseline and follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up samples were independent. NR. Authors reported data excluded from analysis. Of the 2106 mother\u00e2\u0080\u0093child pairs in the baseline sample, 1 child and 2 mothers missed Hb measurements; 8 children had implausible HAZ and 4 children had implausible WHZ values, and 1 mother had implausible BMI (< 12.0 kg/m2). Therefore, these participants were excluded from the analysis involving these outcomes. In addition, 10.9% of the mothers (intervention: 100; control: 129) were pregnant at baseline and were excluded from maternal BMI and underweight analysis. For the 2614 mother\u00e2\u0080\u0093child pairs assessed at follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up, 18 had implausible HAZ and 11 children had implausible WHZ values, and 9.7% mothers (intervention: 125; control: 128) were pregnant.

Under the guidance of HKI, this woman then trained 20 other beneficiary women on how to establish their home gardens and poultry production. Altogether, the project intended to establish 120 VMFs, each of which served as a site for purchasing inputs and ongoing training for all the beneficiary women. For every season (rainy and winter) of the first year, each woman was given a one\u00e2\u0080\u0090off free supply of seeds, saplings and locally bred chicks to establish their home gardens and poultry production. Throughout the intervention, the women met monthly at the VMF to refresh lessons on agriculture techniques and nutrition through social and BCCs, such as optimal infant and young child feeding practices, cooking demonstrations on how to use the EHFP produce to enrich family meals, and participation in routine public health services (immunisation, growth monitoring, vitamin A supplementation and deworming) offered in their communities. The intervention activities were jointly monitored through monthly home visits by trained project staff, female community health volunteers, and agriculture extension officers. During each home visit, the project staff and agriculture extension officers observed the home gardens and poultry, including the number of different varieties of crops cultivated, whether the garden was fenced, how many of poultry birds the family had, whether the poultry had started laying eggs, etc., and provided advice on any garden or poultry issues the family was facing. On these home visits, the project staff and the female community health volunteers also reinforced the educational messages on breastfeeding and complementary feeding to all mothers (Osei 2017).Duration of intervention period: 2.5 years: 2009\u00e2\u0080\u00932012Frequency: For every season (rainy and winter) of the first year, each woman was given a one\u00e2\u0080\u0090off free supply of seeds, saplings and locally bred chicks to establish their home gardens and poultry production.

Pellerano 2014 Study characteristics\t \tMethods\tStudy design: cRCTStudy grouping: parallelHow were missing data handled? HHs that were living elsewhere or unavailable for interview for other reasons were dropped from the study. Analysis was limited to panelled HHs that were observed both at baseline and follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up (25% of the original sample not analysed).Randomisation ratio: 1:1 (clusters = EDs)Recruitment method: field workers visited each randomly selected HH, where the head of each HH was interviewed. In case the head of the HH/carer was N/A, any knowledgeable member of the HH aged > 18 years qualified for the interview.Sample size justification and outcome used: NRSampling method: multistage stratified random cluster sampling. Within 10 community councils, 96 EDs were randomly allocated to the CGP programme or not (primary sampling units) in public lottery events that took place in each ED. EDs that were selected for the programme were paired with EDs that were not (48 pairs). Of these, 40 pairs were randomly selected. Within each selected ED, 2 villages (or clusters) were randomly selected (secondary sampling units). In every cluster, a random sample of 20 HHs (10 eligible and 10 non\u00e2\u0080\u0090eligible at baseline) were randomly selected and interviewed.Study aim or objective: to assess the direct impact of the CGP on the well\u00e2\u0080\u0090being of eligible HHs.

NRRandomisation ratio: N/ARecruitment method: NRSample size justification and outcome used: NRSampling method: used the data set from the Young Lives Ethiopia survey, which offers rich child and HH level panel information for 2 cohorts (born 1994 and 2001), including siblings, which allows study authors to evaluate programme impacts of different age groups from 5 years to 15 years. The Young Lives Ethiopia was a longitudinal cohort study conducted over 3 waves (2002, 2007 and 2009\u00e2\u0080\u00932010). This data set included HHs selected for the PSNP programme and others that were not; and this was identified through survey questionnaire questions. The PSNP combines geographic and community\u00e2\u0080\u0090based targeting to identify chronically food\u00e2\u0080\u0090insecure HHs. Many communities had public meetings to discuss the shortlist for potential beneficiaries of PSNP, which was then approved by the next level of administration. Due to budget constraints, some HHs were short listed, but did not receive the programme. The sample comprised data from 20 sentinel sites chosen in 5 regions. HHs within sites were chosen randomly among those that had children born in the stipulated year. Importantly, PSNP was operating in 15 of these sites with 530/1886 HHs (29.1% of the sample) active beneficiaries of the programme.Study aim or objective: to provide transfers to the food insecure population' and to 'bridge the food gap' (Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, 2004). It operates as a safety net, whereby the public works (also known as cash/food for\u00e2\u0080\u0090work, or workfare) programme operates seasonally, but predictably (and similarly for the direct support, or UCT).Study period: introduced in 2005 and is still ongoing.Unit of allocation or exposure: HHs\t \tParticipants\tBaseline characteristicsIntervention or exposure group: NRControl: NROverall: NRInclusion criteria: targeting criteria for PSNP: HHs were food insecure and had been receiving food aid in the past.Exclusion criteria: NRPretreatment: NRAttrition per relevant group: NR.

The PSNP was designed to provide predictable support for selected HHs over several years. The programme has a principle paying in cash rather than food, with the ratio of cash/food in 2008 at 60/40, and the daily wage rate was ETB 8 in 2008 (USD 0.56).Duration of intervention period: 2005 to ongoingFrequency: public works (also known as cash/food for\u00e2\u0080\u0090work, or workfare) programme operates seasonally but predictably (and similarly for the direct support, or UCT)Number of study contacts: 3; 2002, 2007, 2009\u00e2\u0080\u00932010Providers: Ethiopian governmentDelivery: PSNP, centrally co\u00e2\u0080\u0090ordinated by GovernmentCo\u00e2\u0080\u0090interventions: NRResource requirements: NREconomic indicators: the annual donor financed budget is approximately USD 347 million (about 1.2% of Ethiopia's GDP).

Renzaho 2017 Study characteristics\t \tMethods\tStudy design: controlled prospective studyStudy grouping: N/AHow were missing data handled? to increase the accuracy of the anthropometric indices, implausible values were excluded. Unclear how much data were excluded due to this. No other missing/excluded data reported but according to table 4, data were missing for 10/3000 originally enrolled HHs (7 in intervention group; 3 in control group; both at baseline and follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up for each).Randomisation ratio: N/ARecruitment method: NRSample size justification and outcome used: sample size calculation was primarily to detect meaningful levels of change in the study outcomes compared to the comparison group. Planned to sample only 1 child per HH, hence an equal sample size of 750 HHs at baseline and 750 at follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up was obtained in the intervention (1500) as well as the control area (1500). This sample size was adequate to show a 10% effect size for stunting (primary outcome) among children aged < 5 years at 6 years follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up (32.9% in the intervention vs 40% in the control) with > 80% power and 5% significance level (2\u00e2\u0080\u0090sided test), a design effect of 2% and 5% sampling error. The sample size allowed for a 10% non\u00e2\u0080\u0090response rate. The sample size was adequately powered to detect a 6% effect size in the prevalence of wasting at 6\u00e2\u0080\u0090year follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up and to model associations between outcome and intervention, adjusted for demographics and other variables.Sampling method: the surveys were conducted using a 2\u00e2\u0080\u0090stage cluster sampling method. The first stage involved identifying clusters (wards) within each district to be included in the study. All wards in each district were listed separately in alphabetical order by VDC. Using the 2011 population census data for each ward (cluster), a cumulative population for all wards was computed. From this cumulative list, the required number of clusters in each district was determined using the probability proportional to size sampling method. In the second stage, HHs within the selected clusters were identified for inclusion in the study. A list of HHs in each selected ward was constructed with the help of the local leaders and UNICEF staff. From the list, a HH was selected using a systematic sampling approach. Only HHs with \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 1 child aged < 60 months were eligible for the study. The sampling interval (X) was determined by dividing the total number of HHs in each ward with the expected sample size, and the first HH to be surveyed was randomly selected by choosing a number between 1 and X. For each selected HH, mothers/caretakers of children aged < 5 years volunteered to take part in the surveys, and the interview occurred outside the home, away from other HH members. If the selected HH was not inhabited, or there was no\u00e2\u0080\u0090one at home, the closest neighbouring HH was used for the survey. Sampled about 30 HHs per cluster in each selected district at baseline, midline and endline surveys. For clusters where the number of HHs was < 25, the selected ward and its adjoining neighbour were merged and treated as a single cluster. In HHs with > 1 child, only 1 child was randomly selected for enumeration.Study aim or objective: to evaluate the effectiveness of the synergetic effect of child sensitive social protection programmes, augmented by a capacity building for social protection and embedded within existing government's TRTs for families on child nutritional status.Study period: 6 years: October\u00e2\u0080\u0093December 2009 (pre) to December 2014\u00e2\u0080\u0093February 2015 (post)Unit of allocation or exposure: district\t \tParticipants\tBaseline characteristicsIntervention or exposureAge: child, mean, months: 28.66 (SD 15.36)Place of residence: NRSex: proportion of girls: 44.8% (SD 49.8%); boys: 55.2% (SD 49.8%)Ethnicity and language: ethnicity proportion: disadvantaged ethnic groups: 1.5% (SD 12.0%); Dalit Hill/Terai: 21.3% (SD 41.0%); upper caste group: 77.2% (SD 42.0%)Occupation: NREducation: proportion of fathers with primary education or less: 2.1% (SD 14.5%); secondary level education: 33.1% (SD 47.1%); intermediate or higher education: 64.8% (SD 47.8%).

The CCG provides NPR 200 per month for up to 2 children for poor families with children aged < 5 years in Karnali Zone (Kalikot, Jumla, Mugu, Humla and Dolpa) to complement existing social protection schemes for senior citizens, single women, endangered communities and people with disabilities. The Government of Nepal's CCG is an UCT scheme in which allowances are provided to all eligible HHs. The CCG programme has been supported and enhanced by the capacity building for social protection implemented by a UNICEF/Nepal partnership programme, whose aim has been to design and implement complementary interventions, partly funded by the Asian Development Bank through Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (Table 1). The capacity building for social protection had 4 major components: 1. capacity development of central and local government officials; 2. system development for effective implementation and monitoring of child grant; 3. linking the child grant with nutrition; and 4. grant management, monitoring and audit. The Ministry of Federal Affairs and Local Development (the main executing agency) was responsible for the system development component and the Asia Development Bank together with the Ministry of Federal Affairs and Local Development and the Ministry of Health and Population were responsible for grant management component. (Table 1 of publication for all programme activities).Duration of intervention period: 6 yearsFrequency: assessments were completed and outcome measures recorded pre\u00e2\u0080\u0090 (October\u00e2\u0080\u0093December 2009) and post\u00e2\u0080\u0090 (December 2014 to February 2015) intervention. Distribution of child grants to all children aged < 5 years were done every 4 months (3 times a year). In addition, the intervention group had multiple contacts with study partners, including 1. capacity building activities to enhance capacity of local bodies to deliver the child grant, 2. network enhancing activities aimed at improving child nutrition, 3. social BCC on child nutrition, 4. awareness raising activities for timely birth registration to identify all eligible HHs and about the availability of the CCG, 5. assisting mothers/carers to identify the best possible locally available food and encouraging use of cash grant for nutritious foods and the improvement of nutritional status of children, 6. improving the knowledge and skills of CCG beneficiaries in the areas of infant and young child feeding practices, hygiene, sanitation and other key behaviours linked to child nutrition.Number of study contacts: multiple. Repeat cross\u00e2\u0080\u0090sectional quasi\u00e2\u0080\u0090experimental design with measures taken pre\u00e2\u0080\u0090 (October\u00e2\u0080\u0093December 2009) and post\u00e2\u0080\u0090 (December 2014 to February 2015) intervention in the intervention community (Kalikot district) and comparison communities (Bajhang district).Providers: the Ministry of Federal Affairs and Local Development (the main executing agency) was responsible for the system development component and the Asia Development Bank together with the Ministry of Federal Affairs and Local Development and the Ministry of Health and Population were responsible for grant management component. UNICEF was responsible for implementation of the capacity development and linking CCG with nutrition and supported the Government of Nepal's (Ministry of Federal Affairs and Local Development and Ministry of Health and Population) in implementing key strategies underpinning the intervention.Delivery: the CCG programme was administered and paid for by the Government of Nepal and supported and enhanced by capacity building for social protection implemented by a UNICEF/Nepal partnership programme. UNICEF was responsible for implementation of the capacity development and linking CCGs with nutrition and supported the Government of Nepal (Ministry of Federal Affairs and Local Development and Ministry of Health and Population) in implementing key strategies underpinning the intervention (training, workshops, group meetings, radio messages, campaigns, technical support). The Ministry of Federal Affairs and Local Development (the main executing agency) was responsible for the system development component and the Asia Development Bank together with the Ministry of Federal Affairs and Local Development and the Ministry of Health and Population were responsible for grant management component. The capacity building component was partly funded by the Asian Development Bank through Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction. The intervention was embedded within existing universal social transfer programmes hence ensuring continuity of participation and preventing the disruption in disbursements. The implementation of the intervention involved too many stakeholders with differing expectations and competing objectives, which might have hampered the effective implementation of the project. This challenge was overcome by having clear role and responsibilities and a focal co\u00e2\u0080\u0090ordinating committee overseen by the Government of Nepal.Co\u00e2\u0080\u0090interventions: TRTsResource requirements: NREconomic indicators: NRControlFood access intervention category: increase buying power (weaker)Intervention type: government TRTs for familiesDescription: government's funded TRTs for families.

Authors reported that data were analysed as ITT. However, due to discrepancies in timing of implementation of the interventions in both groups, with the food group receiving the last instalment 15 days before the endline survey whereas in the cash group the transfer was received 49 days before, some HHs were excluded from the analysis: for outcomes that rely on a recall period including the week before the survey (e.g. days in the last 7 the HH consumed meat), the analysis excluded those HHs that received their transfer in the 8\u00e2\u0080\u0090day period before the survey. Other data were also excluded. This analysis conducted throughout this report was restricted to 3353 treatment and comparison HHs for whom consistent data from both the baseline and endline surveys exists. In addition, the remaining HHs not considered here had extensive incomplete, missing or unreliable data for key sections.Randomisation ratio: 1:1. The 136 FDPs within the sample area were randomised into equal numbers of cash or food transfers.Recruitment method: NR. Initial meetings with beneficiaries were held in June 2011 before the first transfer of the 2011 cycle was distributed to sensitise beneficiaries to the programme objectives and logistics. A follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up meeting for cash beneficiaries was held in November 2011 during the first disbursement of cash transfers.Sample size justification and outcome used: NR. Based on the distribution of clusters in the treatment groups and the required sample sizes, 15 intervention HHs and 11 non\u00e2\u0080\u0090beneficiary HHs were randomly selected to be interviewed in each FDP. In total, 3536 HHs were included in the baseline sample. Approximate sample size calculations were conducted across countries at the inception of the study and are found in Ahmed et al. (2010). (Note: we were unable to find this reference.)Sampling method: 14 governorates were chosen to implement the ESN based on the classifications of \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 10% of the population as severely food insecure, with the end objective of reaching \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 75% of this population at the governorate level. The governorates of Hajjah and Ibb were chosen to be the sites of the cash and voucher pilot based on several criteria. These governorates are second\u00e2\u0080\u0090 and third\u00e2\u0080\u0090ranked among the 14 governorates implementing the ESN in terms of absolute numbers of food\u00e2\u0080\u0090insecure people. In addition, Hajjah and Ibb had high percentages of the food\u00e2\u0080\u0090insecure (Hajjah: 46.3% and Ibb: 44.0%, according to the 2009 CFSS), as well as relative stability and implementation feasibility (WFP\u00e2\u0080\u0090CO Yemen 2011a). The 136 FDPs within the sample area were randomised into equal numbers of cash or food transfers. Taking into consideration the context of the project area, the study authors stratified the randomisation of clusters at the governorate level due to the distinct socioeconomic and geographic characteristics of Hajjah and Ibb. Based on the distribution of clusters in the treatment groups and the required sample sizes, 15 intervention HHs and 11 non\u00e2\u0080\u0090beneficiary HHs were randomly selected to be interviewed in each FDP. In total, 3536 HHs were included in the baseline sample. Unclear who the non\u00e2\u0080\u0090beneficiary HHs were; they were not mentioned elsewhere.Study aim or objective: in order to provide rigorous evidence on the relative impact and cost\u00e2\u0080\u0090effectiveness of cash and food transfers, the study authors analysed the results of a cRCT of a seasonal safety net programme implemented by the WFP in rural Yemen. The analysis focused on the relative effectiveness of food and cash transfers. The analysis focused primarily on the differential impacts of these transfer types on food security outcomes.Study period: 7 months. Start and end date of study not clearly reported but it started sometime in 2011, with the first cash disbursement in November 2011. Initial meetings with beneficiaries were held in June 2011 before the first transfer of 2011. A follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up meeting for cash beneficiaries was held in November 2011 during the first disbursement of cash transfers.Unit of allocation or exposure: clusters; FDPs (villages)\t \tParticipants\tBaseline characteristicsIntervention or exposureAge: HH head, mean, years: 47.59.

In addition, Hajjah and Ibb have high percentages of food\u00e2\u0080\u0090insecure people (Hajjah 46.3% and Ibb 44.0%, according to the 2009 CFSS), as well as relative stability and implementation feasibility (WFP\u00e2\u0080\u0090CO Yemen 2011a).Exclusion criteria: NRPretreatment: comparing the food and cash treatment groups, the randomisation appeared to function reasonably well. In terms of HH demographics, food HHs appeared relatively more likely to be headed by females and singles, although the education levels of the HH head did not significantly differ. In terms of assets, cash HHs appeared to be slightly more likely to have more telephones and own their plot of land, and they had a Wealth Index Level 0.09 SDs higher than food HHs. These differences were relatively small in magnitude, but significant at the 10% level, implying that controlling for baseline SES in the main analysis would improve the accuracy of estimated treatment effects. Note: the baseline characteristics below were taken from Table 2. (Table 3 could also have been chosen: subsample only. However, text with respect to Table 3 seemed not in line with what is represented in Table 3.) Furthermore, comparisons of means of key outcome variables at baseline were only presented for treatment (food and cash) vs comparison.Attrition per relevant group: data for 183 HHs excluded from analysis (5% of baseline sample): of the 183 HHs in the original sampling frame not included in this analysis, only 26 were omitted due to pure attrition. These 26 HHs had moved away from their location during the baseline survey, and were unable to be interviewed for the endline survey. The majority of these HHs originally resided in the Al\u00e2\u0080\u0090Wahdah FDP in Hajjah, and were forced to move due to ongoing tribal violence, but these HHs were not included because multiple beneficiaries lived in the same HH. The remaining HHs not considered here had extensive incomplete, missing or unreliable data for key sections. Attrition per group was NR. Furthermore, for outcomes that relied on a recall period including the week before the survey (e.g. days in the last 7 the HH consumed meat), the analysis excluded those HHs that received their transfer in the 8\u00e2\u0080\u0090day period before the survey. However, they stated that as a whole, the summary statistics did not suggest that selecting the subsample of food HHs who received the transfers > 8 days from survey time introduces discernible bias into the analysis.Description of subgroups measured and reported: dietary diversity in infants and young children: aged 6\u00e2\u0080\u009323 months and 24\u00e2\u0080\u009359 monthsTotal number completed and analysed per relevant group: 1581 HHs analysed.

The bi\u00e2\u0080\u0090monthly food ration to cover this gap for a mean HH size of 7 people is 50 kg of wheat flour and 5.0 L of vegetable oil.Duration of intervention period: 7 months. However, the timing of transfers/disbursements was not the same in both groups. The first food disbursement began in August prior to the baseline survey, and the second transfer began in late October. The final transfer, however, did not occur until April.Frequency: transfer every 2 monthsNumber of study contacts: 2; baseline and endline surveys of both beneficiaries and those with proxy mean scores just above the qualifying threshold were conducted in all clusters.Providers: HH\u00e2\u0080\u0090level transfers were distributed in co\u00e2\u0080\u0090ordination with local partners: the Ministry of Education (MoE) in the case of food transfers. Transfers were given out at district branches of the PPSC in each governorate (see Annexe 1, PPSC branches in Hajjah and Ibb).Delivery: the food transfers were stored in warehouses outside of Sana'a and distributed through local government\u00e2\u0080\u0090run primary schools with the assistance of a FDC (see Annexe 2, FDPs in Hajjah and Ibb). The FDC is comprised of approximately 3 individuals per FDP including a school teacher from each primary school, a local council administrator and a guard. Each individual beneficiary held an WFP ration card containing a unique ID number, photograph, and other identifying information, and presented the card at the time of transfer pickup. Because beneficiaries may not always have been able to travel due to physical disability or other reasons, other family members can collect transfers on behalf of the beneficiary if they have the ration card, national ID of the beneficiary and self\u00e2\u0080\u0090identification. Initial meetings with beneficiaries were held in June 2011 before the first transfer of the 2011 cycle was distributed to sensitise beneficiaries to the programme objectives and logistics.Co\u00e2\u0080\u0090interventions: NRResource requirements: the FDC is comprised of approximately 3 individuals per FDP including a school teacher from each primary school, a local council administrator and a guard.Economic indicators: food incurred higher costs for distribution and those costs associated with in\u00e2\u0080\u0090country transport, as well as warehousing and other associated costs for commodity storage. Ocean freight, port operations and other external shipping expenses were excluded from this analysis. However, internal transportation and labour costs were included to accurately reflect the cost of food distribution in country. Cash modality was less expensive per beneficiary (USD 162.65) than the food modality (USD 181.49). These costs included beneficiary verification and the cost of the transfers itself during the 3\u00e2\u0080\u0090cycle intervention period. On a per\u00e2\u0080\u0090transfer basis (Figure 3), excluding the cost of the transfer, the modality\u00e2\u0080\u0090specific cost of cash (USD 4.09) was approximately half as expensive compared to food (USD 10.37). Incorporation of the beneficiary cost to collect transfer raised the per\u00e2\u0080\u0090transfer cost (excluding the value of the transfer) of cash to USD 8.22. For food transfers, addition of beneficiary costs raised the per\u00e2\u0080\u0090transfer cost (excluding the transfer value) to USD 11.35. Thus, including the beneficiary costs reduces the per\u00e2\u0080\u0090transfer cost gap from USD 6.28 to USD 3.13.ControlFood access intervention category: increase buying powerIntervention type: UCTDescription: HHs in cash FDPs received 3 cash transfers of an amount equivalent to the local value of the food basket (about USD 50). The total value of the cash transfer was approximately USD 49 (YER 10,500) per transfer per HH, a figure based on the mean equivalent price of the food ration on local markets. Cash transfer HHs could collect cash at any time up to 25 days after disbursement. In the case of cash transfer FDPs, a second resensitisation campaign was held between 22 and 25 November after funds were transferred to PPSC to reinforce messages from the first campaign.Duration of intervention period: 7 months. However, the timing of transfers/disbursements was not the same in both groups. The first food disbursement began 3 August prior to the baseline survey, and the second transfer began in late October. The final transfer, however, did not occur until April.Frequency: 3 cash transfers; every 2 monthsNumber of study contacts: 2; baseline and endline surveys of both beneficiaries and those with proxy mean scores just above the qualifying threshold were conducted in all clusters.Providers: HH\u00e2\u0080\u0090level transfers are distributed in coordination with local partners: the Yemen PPSC in the case of cash transfers.

A follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up meeting for cash beneficiaries was held in November 2011 during the first disbursement of cash transfers. Cash transfer HHs could collect cash at any time up to 25 days after disbursement.Co\u00e2\u0080\u0090interventions: NRResource requirements: HHs had to invest income in significant travel to receive the cash transfer.Economic indicators: a primary cost driver for cash was the 3% fee of total cash transferred each cycle as incurred by the post office. Cash modality was less expensive per beneficiary (USD 162.65) than the food modality (USD 181.49). These costs included beneficiary verification and the cost of the transfers itself during the 3\u00e2\u0080\u0090cycle intervention period. On a per\u00e2\u0080\u0090transfer basis (Figure 3), excluding the cost of the transfer, the modality specific cost of cash (USD 4.09) was approximately half as expensive as compared to food (USD 10.37). Incorporation of the beneficiary cost to collect transfer raises the per\u00e2\u0080\u0090transfer cost (excluding the value of the transfer) of cash to USD 8.22. For food transfers, addition of beneficiary costs raises the per\u00e2\u0080\u0090transfer cost (excluding the transfer value) to USD 11.35. Thus, including the beneficiary costs reduces the per\u00e2\u0080\u0090transfer cost gap from USD 6.28 to USD 3.13.\t \tOutcomes\tFood expenditureFood security: days in the past week that HHs/adults/children were required to reduce the amount of food consumed at or frequency of meals consumed; months in the previous 6 that HHs had difficulty satisfying their food needsDietary diversity: HDDS (number of distinct food categories consumed by the HH in the previous 7 days); probability of having a low FCS (< 28.5)\t \tIdentification\tSponsorship source: government of Spain.Country: YemenSetting: poor HHs in rural communities in poorest districts in YemenAuthor's name: Benjamin SchwabEmail: b.schwab@cgiar.orgDeclarations of interest: NRStudy or programme name and acronym: NRType of record: report\t \tNotes\t\u00c2\u00a0\t \tRisk of bias\t \tBias\tAuthors' judgement\tSupport for judgement\t \tRandom sequence generation (Selection bias)\tUnclear risk\tNot described how randomisation was conducted other than (quote) \"In the intervention under study, 136 village clusters (known as Food Distribution Points) were randomly assigned to receive either food or cash assistance.\"\t \tAllocation concealment (Selection bias)\tLow risk\tAllocation was at cluster level, by FDP.\t \tBaseline characteristics similar (Selection bias)\tUnclear risk\tThere were many disparities in baseline characteristics between the groups.

These differences were relatively small in magnitude, but significant at the 10% level, implying that controlling for baseline SES in the main analysis will improve the accuracy of estimated treatment effects.With respect to the subgroup: comparing those included and those excluded within the food treatment group (Table 3), it becomes clear that while the excluded group was slightly more likely to come from Hajjah, differences in other indicators were generally not significant economically and statistically. The lone exception was that the excluded group had higher motor vehicle ownership rates (5% vs 1%), and slightly higher wealth index levels (not statistically significant). As a whole, the summary statistics did not suggest that selecting the subsample of food HHs who received the transfers > 8 days from survey time introduced discernible bias into the analysis.\t \tBaseline outcome measurements similar (Selection bias)\tUnclear risk\tDespite the fact that the main analysis was comparing the food and cash transfers, the comparison of baseline outcome measures was only presented for treatment (food and cash) vs comparison (Table 5).\u00e2\u0080\u00a8The baseline data were not true baseline as the food transfer group had already received the first transfer.\t \tBlinding of participants and personnel (Performance bias)\tLow risk\tNo blinding was possible, but this was unlikely to influence the delivery of the intervention.\t \tBlinding of outcome assessment (Detection bias)\tHigh risk\tBlinding was not possible.

Skoufias 2013 Study characteristics\t \tMethods\tStudy design: cRCTStudy grouping: parallelHow were missing data handled? Missing data were excluded from analysis. Sample of HHs used for the analysis of consumption was what remained after dropping HHs with food consumption < 1 percentile and > 99 percentile of the food distribution in the sample. An additional 802 HHs were excluded from the analysis because of missing or incomplete data (Leroy 2010). Analyses provide an estimate of ITT effect of in\u00e2\u0080\u0090kind and cash transfers.Randomisation ratio: 1:1:1:1Recruitment method: NRSample size justification and outcome used: sample size was calculated so that statistical tests had the power to detect statistically significant and biologically relevant differences in several nutritional and economic variables. Specifically, the calculations of the sample size prior to the baseline survey were based on 60 communities per treatment group, a power of 80%, and a minimum detectable difference in food per capita consumption between each treatment and control group of 17.8%. The final sample consisted of 33 HHs per community and around 52 communities per treatment group (ICC 0.220) (Skoufias 2013).Sampling method: 2\u00e2\u0080\u0090stage random sampling. A random sample of 208 rural communities was drawn from a pool of communities within 8 of the poorest states in the Southeast region. Within each community, 33 HHs were selected using systematic random sampling. After baseline data collection, the 208 selected communities (6687 HHs) were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 study groups: food basket without education (52 communities, 1657 HHs), food basket with education (52 communities, 1680 HHs), cash transfer with education (53 communities, 1687 communities) or control (51 communities, 1663 HHs). Due to partial contamination of the original evaluation design the analysis pools both in\u00e2\u0080\u0090kind/food basket groups.Study aim or objective: to examine the impacts of cash and in\u00e2\u0080\u0090kind transfers on HH welfare as measured by food and total consumption, poverty and labour supply (Skoufias 2008; 2013). To estimate the programme's impact on HH energy and macro\u00e2\u0080\u0090 and micronutrient consumption and to evaluate whether the cash and in\u00e2\u0080\u0090kind transfers had a differential effect on these outcomes (LeRoy 2010).Study period: delivery of the PAL benefits began in June 2004 and the mean time of exposure to the availability of the programme transfers was 14 months.Unit of allocation or exposure: communities\t \tParticipants\tBaseline characteristicsIntervention (cash transfer)Age: NRPlace of residence: NRSex: NREthnicity and language: NROccupation: NREducation: NRSES: mean total HH expenditure (per AE per month), n = 1492: MXN 551.6 (SD 336.5)Social capital: NRNutritional status: mean dietary intake (per AE per day), n = 1492: total energy (kcal) 2776.8 (SD 1172.2); energy from fruits and vegetables (kcal): 79.7 (SD 70.5); energy from cereals and legumes (kcal): 1723.7 (SD 916.5); energy from animal source food (kcal): 261.7 (SD 214.0); energy from processed food (kcal): 664 (SD 344.1)Morbidities: NRConcomitant or previous care: NRControlAge: NRPlace of residence: NRSex: NREthnicity and language: NROccupation: NREducation: NRSES: mean total HH expenditure (per AE per month), n = 1384: MXN 571.3 (SD 352.3)Social capital: NRNutritional status: mean dietary intake (per AE per day), n = 1384: total energy (kcal): 2702 (SD 1140.3); energy from fruits and vegetables (kcal): 81.8 (SD 73.6); energy from cereals and legumes (kcal): 1625.3 (SD 838.9); energy from animal source food (kcal): 278.1 (SD 229.6)Morbidities: NRConcomitant or previous care: NROverallAge: NRPlace of residence: NRSex: NREthnicity and language: NROccupation: NREducation: at baseline, about 40% of the HHs heads had completed primary school.SES: families lived in homes with a mean of < 3 rooms.

However, DID analysis accounted for this imbalance. In Leroy 2010, baseline nutrient intakes in cash transfer and control groups were similar.Attrition per relevant group: intervention group (cash transfers with education): 195/1687 (11.6%); control group: 279/1663 (16.8%).

The PAL programme offers nutrition and health education sessions (platicas), as well as participation in programme\u00e2\u0080\u0090related logistic activities. However, attendance was not compulsory. HHs received either a cash transfer of MXN 150/month (equivalent to USD 14 at the time) or a monthly food basket with a cost to the programme of MXN 150. The size of the cash transfer and the amount of food was the same for all HHs regardless of family size or composition. The value of the food basket at local prices was 30% higher for consumers than the actual cost to the programme (Leroy 2010).Duration of intervention period: delivery of the PAL benefits began in June 2004 and the mean time of exposure to the availability of the programme transfers was 14 months.Frequency: every 2 monthsNumber of study contacts: the control and the treatment groups were surveyed on 2 occasions 2 years apart: at baseline in October 2003 to April 2004, and at follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up in October\u00e2\u0080\u0093December 2005.Providers: Mexican government, specifically: benefits were distributed through DICONSA, the related federal programme which distributes non\u00e2\u0080\u0090perishable foods and housekeeping goods throughout rural poor communities.Delivery: distribution of transfers was through DICONSA stores (Mexican government's agency that manages the supply of food). 75% of beneficiaries were women. The value of cash transfer in real terms was smaller than the in\u00e2\u0080\u0090kind transfers. The cash transfers provided by the programme were implemented for those very isolated communities where DICONSA did not regularly reach.Co\u00e2\u0080\u0090interventions: none reportedResource requirements: NREconomic indicators: cash transfers: USD 14/month.

All Vitality members were eligible for the healthy food benefit at no additional cost to them, but they had to activate the benefit online or by telephone. Following activation, members immediately received a 10% rebate for healthy foods, which increased to a 25% rebate on completion of an online health risk assessment questionnaire. The rebate was capped at a ZAR 4000 maximum monthly purchase (about USD 480) per HH and a limit related to participation in health promotion activities. Food items eligible for the rebate programme were selected by a panel consisting of nutritionists, physicians and behavioural scientists based on international guidelines on healthy nutrition, including those from South Africa and the US. Complete list of eligible items (> 6000) was on Discovery's website (www.discovery.co.za) and distributed as brochures to programme participants.

Monthly allowance of XOF 10,000 (USD 17) was given by mobile phone (offered by the project) to participating HHs. Specifically designated mothers were the primary recipients of the transfer because they were usually in charge of child care.Duration of intervention period: 5 months (July\u00e2\u0080\u0093November) in 2013 and 5 months (July\u00e2\u0080\u0093November) in 2014. These months represent the 'lean season' in Burkina Faso.Frequency: monthlyNumber of study contacts: 9 visits. Baseline data collected 1 month earlier in the intervention group than in the control group in order to enable cash transfer to start on time. Follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up visits performed at the same time in the 2 groups. Data collection lasted 29 month (June 2013 to October 2015).Providers: ECHO trained project staffDelivery: a dedicated team supervised and followed up cash transfer activities jointly with the research team. A partnership with a mobile telephone company enabled cash distribution via mobile telephone. Before the intervention, all mothers in the intervention group received an identity card provided by the field teams, a mobile telephone and a subscriber identification module card linked to an electronic account. At the time of distribution, mothers received a text message providing a code and notifying them that their account was credited. Mothers were thus invited to visit cash withdrawal points to collect their money. Presentation of the identity card and the code granted access to the money. Mothers confirmed the cash withdrawal by signing follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up lists. All study participants in the intervention group (100%) received their monthly allowance within 1 week. Operational constraints such as mothers' limited knowledge about the use of mobile telephones, difficulty charging the mobile telephones because of the lack of electricity and low literacy rate among mothers were encountered during the delivery of cash. Sessions demonstrating basic uses of a mobile telephone, home visits by cash transfer supervisors to inform HHs about the scheduled dates for cash transfers, switching subscriber identification module cards from 1 telephone to another at cash withdrawal points, and direct transfers in remote villages were mitigation strategies put in place to tackle these difficulties.Co\u00e2\u0080\u0090interventions: none reported but authors mentioned that a national social protection policy that promotes social transfer mechanisms to the poorest and most vulnerable was adopted in 2012 to enhance food security among the population.Resource requirements: NREconomic indicators: over 1 year, a total of XOF 50,000 (USD 85) was transferred to each eligible HH, representing; 33% of the 2014 national poverty line, estimated at XOF 153,530 (USD 260).ControlFood access intervention category: non\u00e2\u0080\u0090active controlIntervention type: N/ADescription: mothers of children in control group did not receive a cash grant.

Representatives of each of the 32 villages drew blindly from a bag one of the 32 identical papers with \"cash\" or \"no cash\" written on it.\"\t \tAllocation concealment (Selection bias)\tLow risk\tAllocation to intervention groups was by village at the beginning of the study.\t \tBaseline characteristics similar (Selection bias)\tLow risk\tQuote: \"Overall, baseline characteristics were balanced between the intervention and the control groups (Table 1).\" Comment: intervention group had more young children (aged < 6 years) compared to control group but all analyses adjusted for child's age at baseline. In addition, Houngbe 2017 reported that adjustment had been done for important prognostic covariates.\t \tBaseline outcome measurements similar (Selection bias)\tLow risk\tChildren in intervention group were more likely to be wasted. No morbidity outcomes measured at baseline. Analysis adjusted for morbidity status and WHZ at baseline.\t \tBlinding of participants and personnel (Performance bias)\tLow risk\tNo blinding possible but this was unlikely to affect participant behaviour.\t \tBlinding of outcome assessment (Detection bias)\tHigh risk\tOutcome assessors were not blinded to treatment assignment. Morbidity outcomes were recalled by mothers and these could have been influenced by knowledge of treatment allocation.\t \tProtection against contamination (Performance bias)\tLow risk\tAllocation was by village and it was unlikely that control villages received treatment. Given the cluster randomised design of the study combined with poor and very poor participants who likely did not travel to other villages often, the risk of contamination was not judged to be appreciable.\t \tIncomplete outcome data (Attrition bias)\tLow risk\tAttrition was not high: 99/1278 (7.8%) children enrolled LTFU, due to either death or leaving the study area. 57/644 (8.9%) children in intervention group and 42/634 (6.6%) children in control group LTFU from visits 1 to 9. Data from children with < 2 measurements were excluded: 14 (2.2%) children in intervention group (2.2%) and 14 (2.2%) children in control group were excluded.\t \tSelective outcome reporting (Reporting bias)\tHigh risk\tSome morbidity outcomes reported in the protocol were NR in published paper (oedema and measles).\t \tOther bias\tUnclear risk\tMisclassification bias: unlikely. Measurement bias: unlikely. Incorrect analysis: unclear. Adjusted for clustering. Poisson regression model adjusted for clustering by village, household and child. The payment ('compensations') for the time control participants spent on the study may have resulted in volunteer bias, which may have altered effect sizes. Furthermore, the payment in itself was not meaningfully different from the intervention (though no values were specified) and may have influenced outcomes as well. Verbowski 2018 Study characteristics\t \tMethods\tStudy design: cRCTStudy grouping: parallel groupHow were missing data handled? In 9 cases, the participant who had been enrolled at baseline was N/A at the time of data collection; so another adult female HH member of the appropriate age completed the 24\u00e2\u0080\u0090hour recall. When nutrient values were N/A for protein, fat, iron, zinc, calcium, vitamin A, thiamine or riboflavin, values were imputed from USDA food composition equivalents, based on values per 100 g by weight (USDA 2016). Given the high attrition rates, instead of estimating missing data using multiple imputation, study authors employed the direct maximum likelihood method to account for the missing values at 22 months, which uses each respondent's available data to compute the likelihood function. The overall likelihood was the product of 2 factors: 1 computed for those respondents with missing data on some variables and 1 for those with complete data on all variables. Parameter estimation and SEs were derived from maximising the overall likelihood function.Randomisation ratio: 1:1:1Recruitment method: among the eligible villages (190, which were those not already participating in other development programmes), random selection was used to identify 90 villages to participate in the study.Sample size justification and outcome used: number of clusters and HHs within each cluster was estimated based on the proportion of anaemic women and children, with 80% power and an a priori significant level of 0.025, to account for multiple comparisons. Assuming a 50% prevalence of anaemia and an interclass correlation of 0.05, a sample size of 300 for each group provided 80% power to detect a 15% absolute reduction in the prevalence of anaemia.Sampling method: with randomised villages, purposive sampling was used to identify 10 HHs per village to participate. Half of the participants (5/10 HHs within each cluster) were randomly selected to complete endline dietary assessment.Study aim or objective: to examine the effect of EHFP with or without aquaculture on dietary intake and prevalence of inadequate intake of select nutrients among women and children living in rural Cambodia, compared to controls.Study period: July 2012 to June 2014, a 22\u00e2\u0080\u0090month periodUnit of allocation or exposure: villages\t \tParticipants\tBaseline characteristicsEHFP + aquacultureAge, mean: women, years: 29.4 (SD 6.3); children, months: 24.2 (SD 15.0)Place of residence: NRSex: adults were all women; sex of children, n %: 167 boys (55.7)Ethnicity and language: NROccupation: NREducation: women's schooling, mean, years: 3.8 (SD 3.0)SES: Wealth Index quintiles, n (%): lowest: 49 (16.3); middle: 67 (22.3); highest: 68 (22.7); HH size, mean: 4.6 (SD 1.5)Social capital: NRNutritional status: women, n (%): underweight: 40 (14.2); anaemia: 110 (39.0).

Therefore, these were included in the multivariable models as potential confounders.Attrition per relevant group: EHFP + aquaculture group: 7 women and 7 children LTFU; EHFP group: 4 women and 4 children LTFU; control group: 10 women and 10 children LTFU. The overall HH attrition rate was 16.2% (146), which did not differ across groups (P = 0.74), but attrition for women overall was higher (38.6%, 348), mainly due to employment\u00e2\u0080\u0090related temporary migration. Primary outcome data were available for 179 (control), 185 (EHFP) and 188 (EHFP + aquaculture) women and 232 (control), 255 (EHFP) and 245 (EHFP + aquaculture) children. Venous blood samples were successfully obtained from 88% of the subset of 450 women at 22 months. LTFU for the venous blood draw was higher among women in control group (22.0%, 33) than in the EHFP (6.7%, 10) and EHFP + aquaculture (6.0%, 9) groups.Description of subgroups measured and reported: only a subgroup of participants measured and analysed per group: of the 10 HHs per village, only 5 per group were randomly selected to be assessed for dietary intake outcomes and analysed as such. Of these, further subgroups (43 woman\u00e2\u0080\u0093child pairs for EHFP + aquaculture group; 45 woman\u00e2\u0080\u0093child pairs for EHFP group; 46 woman\u00e2\u0080\u0093child pairs for the control group) were selected to do a repeat dietary intake assessment on a non\u00e2\u0080\u0090consecutive day.Total number completed and analysed per relevant group: EHFP + aquaculture group: 143 women and 142 children analysed; EHFP group: 146 women and 144 children analysed; control group: 140 women and 135 children analysed.Total number enrolled per relevant group: each group had 30 villages randomly assigned to them, and from each village 10 HHs were enrolled, which provided per group: 300 HHs, 300 women (of which 150 women's venous blood samples were taken), 300 childrenTotal number randomised per relevant group: see above\t \tInterventions\tIntervention characteristicsEHFP + aquacultureFood access intervention category: increasing buying powerIntervention type: income generationDescription: basic agricultural inputs and training, and nutrition and hygiene education.

    "INTRO": "Background Description of the condition Food security \"exists when all people, at all times, have physical, social and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life\" (FAO 2019). When these conditions are not met, the population and people within it\u00c2\u00a0are said to be food insecure. Food insecurity and associated undernutrition affect health and socioeconomic development on different levels (Black 2013; Ecker 2012; Victora 2008). For adults, it has been associated with an increased risk of disability, morbidity and mortality, and with a decrease in income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation potential (Black 2008; Black 2013; Victora 2008). Food insecurity is also associated with mental health problems such as depression and anxiety, both in high\u00e2\u0080\u0090income as well as low\u00e2\u0080\u0090 and middle\u00e2\u0080\u0090income settings (Arenas 2019; Carter 2011; Cole 2011; Hadley 2006; Hadley 2008; Maynard 2018). Children who are affected may experience impaired physical and cognitive development, and decreased school performance (Black 2008; Black 2013; Liu 2012; Victora 2008). At the macro\u00e2\u0080\u0090level, undernutrition is associated with direct and indirect costs. Direct costs are due to increased healthcare costs for preventing and treating affected individuals (Black 2013; Victora 2008). Indirect costs are due to poor productivity and losses of human resources due to mental and physical under\u00e2\u0080\u0090performance and death (Victora 2008). Given these far\u00e2\u0080\u0090reaching consequences, and considering that food security is defined as a human right by the United Nations (FAO 2003), it is important to address food insecurity. Building on the first 2010 to 2015 Millennium Development Goal (MDG), which was to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger, the second 2015 Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) aimed to end hunger by 2030 and sought to \"achieve food security and improve nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture\" (UN 2015). Progress towards this goal\u00c2\u00a0has been insufficient. Following decades of decline, the global prevalence of undernourishment, has, since 2015,\u00c2\u00a0increased to levels seen in 2010\u00e2\u0080\u00932011, approximately 11% (FAO 2019). Although this prevalence is highest in Asia, it has been sharply increasing in Africa which is now home to 30% of the world's undernourished population (FAO 2019). The global number of undernourished people, estimated at 820 million in 2018, has been steadily rising particularly in Africa, Latin America and Western Asia. Globally, the prevalence and number of stunted children under five years of age has decreased since 2012, although this is uneven as Africa and Asia account for more than 90% of stunted and wasted children globally (FAO 2019; SOWC 2019). Factors that have delayed improvements in rates of chronic hunger include the food price crisis of 2008, brought about by trade restrictions of major food exporters, biofuels policies and increased commodity speculation, among others (Ecker 2012). The higher demand for food due to changing dietary patterns and growing population, and food price increases and volatility due to climate change are other factors that will contribute to food insecurity in the long term (Ecker 2012). Food security is a complex concept that encompasses several different dimensions (Ecker 2012; FAO 2013; FAO 2019; Gross 2000), where 1. food availability refers to the quantity of food that is physically available in the relevant vicinity of a population during a given period (ACF\u00e2\u0080\u0090IN 2008); 2. food access is a measure of the capacity of a household to acquire sufficient and appropriate foods to ensure a diet that is diverse, nutrient\u00e2\u0080\u0090rich and safe, and that satisfies the nutrient needs of its members during a given period, which is often influenced by the proximity and price of food (ACF\u00e2\u0080\u0090IN 2008; WHO 2013); 3. food utilisation refers to the intake of food by the people within a household and how the body assimilates the nutrients physiologically; and 4. food stability introduces the condition of time to the food security concept, that is it refers to chronic or transient food insecurity (FAO 2003). Chronic food insecurity refers to long\u00e2\u0080\u0090term, persistent lack of food and results from continued problems with structural poverty, relating to the inability of the labour market to produce enough jobs to keep people out of poverty, low incomes and with lack of sufficient social safety nets to assist the poor (Ecker 2012; FAO 2003; Rank 2003). In contrast, transient food insecurity refers to food and nutrient shortages during certain periods of food crises due to natural disasters, economic collapse or conflict (Ecker 2012; FAO 2003). In addition, the nutrition dimension was added to the food security concept at the 2009 World Food Summit (Ecker 2012) as food insecurity is associated with nutrient deficiencies and poor nutritional outcomes. Furthermore, food and nutrient intake interact in a bidirectional manner with health status (Ecker 2012). This means that nutritional status is the primary measure of food security. The four dimensions of food security operate at different levels of influence, although these are often inter\u00e2\u0080\u0090related (Ecker 2012; Gross 2000). At the macro\u00e2\u0080\u0090level (national, regional, global) and meso\u00e2\u0080\u0090level (community), food security issues are mainly related to food availability and stability, whereas at the micro\u00e2\u0080\u0090level they are mainly related to food access and utilisation by households and individuals (Ecker 2012; Gross 2000; Pinstrup\u00e2\u0080\u0090Andersen 2009). Food security in one level does not ensure food security at another level (Gross 2000). For example, food might be available at the national level but not accessible for certain disadvantaged communities or districts, or among lower income or otherwise marginalised population groups. In Ghana, despite improvements in reducing poverty and increasing food production, there has been less progress in reducing undernutrition and disparities remain (FAO 2013; Hjelm 2013). There, poorer households and those headed by women tend to be more food insecure due to their low\u00e2\u0080\u0090diversity diets compared with the wealthier or male\u00e2\u0080\u0090headed households (FAO 2013; Hjelm 2013). In Nepal, there is still widespread undernutrition despite the country producing sufficient food, and those living in rural areas are at a higher risk of food insecurity and have a higher prevalence of undernutrition and stunting in children as poor infrastructures and poverty limit their physical and economic access to food (FAO 2013; MOHP 2012). Furthermore, households might have access to food, but this does not guarantee that all individuals in the household are able to access and utilise sufficient amounts of good quality and safe food. This is because the distribution of food within the household may be influenced by cultural beliefs, practices, attitudes, gender and age\u00e2\u0080\u0090specific roles and responsibilities, as well as decision\u00e2\u0080\u0090making hierarchies (Gittelsohn 2003; Pinstrup\u00e2\u0080\u0090Andersen 2009; Renzaho 2010). In addition to the burden of undernutrition, low\u00e2\u0080\u0090 and middle\u00e2\u0080\u0090income countries (LMICs) also have high rates of overweight and obesity that are on the rise (Hossain 2007; Popkin 2012; Subramanian 2011). In an analysis of data from 54 LMICs, 27% of women were overweight (Subramanian 2011). The prevalence of overweight in 2008 ranged from approximately 18% in low\u00e2\u0080\u0090income countries to 59% in upper middle\u00e2\u0080\u0090income countries, with a mean prevalence of 28% in the African region (WHO 2010). Among children under five years of age, the prevalence of overweight and obesity is also increasing, with 12.9% of boys and 13.4% of girls overweight in LMICs in 2013 (Ng 2014). Most of this burden is concentrated in Africa and Asia, regions that accounted for almost three\u00e2\u0080\u0090quarters of the global share of overweight children in 2018 (FAO 2019; SOWC 2019). The increased rates of overweight and obesity are associated with the nutrition transition and poorer\u00e2\u0080\u0090quality diets increasingly consisting of more affordable processed foods, high intake of refined sugars and fats, and increased intake of food away from home, further exacerbated by decreased levels of physical activity (Popkin 2012; SOWC 2019). In LMICs, the consumption of processed or junk foods and sugar\u00e2\u0080\u0090sweetened beverages has increased, with 54% of the global consumption of soft drinks 1997 and 2010 occurring in LMICs (Basu 2013). These dietary patterns are partly the result of high food prices, which cause consumers, particularly those in poorer households, to buy less\u00e2\u0080\u0090expensive foods. These are often energy dense (higher in calories) and less nutritious (containing fewer nutrients per serving size). Consumption of these foods is, therefore, associated with increased risk of overweight, obesity and micronutrient deficiencies. In this context, it is important to consider the quantity and quality of the food intake in any intervention. Description of the intervention Scoping review: preparation for this systematic review The complexity of food security allows for a wide range of interventions addressing its different dimensions at varying levels of influence. In order to better conceptualise the framework for our review with regards to the type(s) of intervention(s) to assess, the eligibility criteria for study selection and the outcomes to be assessed, we conducted a scoping review of existing systematic reviews of interventions addressing food security in LMICs (more information about the methods is available on request). We included 29 systematic reviews in the scoping review (references available on request). Fourteen reviews addressed food availability, mainly assessing food production interventions and food utilisation (13 reviews, including five which also addressed availability), specifically around issues of nutrition education for people to improve their dietary intake. Seven reviews addressed food access. The scoping review also revealed that the included reviews were unclear regarding the description of participants and settings, types of interventions and comparisons, or the outcomes they would assess (Table 7). The quality of reviews varied considerably, some with very low\u00e2\u0080\u0090quality scores using the AMSTAR tool (Shea 2009). Interventions selected based on scoping review results Based on the findings of the scoping review, we decided to focus this Cochrane Review on community\u00e2\u0080\u0090level interventions that aim to improve access to nutritious food in LMICs; as we found that there are fewer reviews addressing food access compared to food availability or utilisation. Furthermore, we know that in many areas of LMICs, nutritious food is available at a national level, but physical distance and financial constraints prevent thousands of people from accessing the food (FAO 2013). As explained above, increased intake of ultraprocessed food products and sugar\u00e2\u0080\u0090sweetened beverages has contributed to the rise in overweight and obesity in LMICs and poor diet quality is also responsible for micronutrient deficiencies. Thus, interventions should aim to improve access to nutritious food. Nutritious foods can be defined as those that are nutrient dense, that is providing substantial amounts of vitamins and minerals (Pennington 2007). This includes fresh or minimally processed foods from the different food groups, such as whole grains, lean meats, dairy products, legumes, vegetables and fruits, and excludes ultraprocessed products and sugar\u00e2\u0080\u0090sweetened beverages that provide empty calories (Drewnowski 2005; Ministry of Health of Brazil 2014). The interventions addressing food access include those aimed at infrastructure and transport, food prices, the social environment, coping strategies and buying power. In our scoping review, we found no systematic reviews addressing infrastructure and transport or coping strategies. We did, however, find reviews focusing on food prices, social environment and buying power, but these did not assess all relevant outcomes and not all were of good quality. Therefore, we included all these interventions addressing food access in this review. We chose to assess community\u00e2\u0080\u0090level interventions because every community member residing in the setting where they are implemented can potentially benefit from them (McLeroy 2003). These types of interventions have been shown to be effective (Bhandari 2003; Mohammadifard 2009), and include interventions that take place across cities or within community institutions, such as schools, neighbourhoods, churches or work sites. The intervention may involve individuals, families, organisations or public policy. This review focused on LMICs as they experience the greatest burden from food insecurity and malnutrition and because another Cochrane Review will address food security in developed countries (Burns 2010). How the intervention might work Based on the literature cited in the above sections, and on guidance on how to use logic models in systematic reviews (Rohwer 2016), we developed a logic model that illustrates how interventions addressing food insecurity might work in improving the nutritional status of individuals (Figure 1). In this model, we present interventions that address food availability, access and utilisation. The interventions may operate at different levels of influence, including the macro (national, regional, global), meso (community) and micro (household and individual) levels. As mentioned above, food security at one level does not ensure food security at another level (Gross 2000). As our review focused on chronic food insecurity, the logic model does not include interventions that address transient food insecurity. Although this logic model encompasses three dimensions of food security \u00e2\u0080\u0093 availability, access and utilisation \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we only explored how interventions addressing access to food may lead to food and nutrition security. As mentioned above, access to food concerns the ability of households (and communities) to acquire sufficient and appropriate foods to ensure a diet that is diverse, nutrient dense and safe, and that satisfies the nutrient needs of its members (ACF\u00e2\u0080\u0090IN 2008; WHO 2013). This logic model provides examples of interventions that address the determinants of food access. These include income\u00e2\u0080\u0090 or employment\u00e2\u0080\u0090generating opportunities, coping strategies (e.g. borrowing money from a community fund, childcare), social grants, food price policies and regulations, rural infrastructure development, and food or cash vouchers. The direct effects of these interventions include increased financial resources in the household, reduced food prices, increased social support and assistance (e.g. from family, neighbours or the government), having adequate facilities to store food, and ensuring that there is affordable transport to food outlets as well as existence of food outlets closer to where people live (Cotta 2013; Ecker 2012; FAO 2012). Many of these factors interact with each other. For example, having more money may enable the household to buy a fridge to store fresh food, being able to borrow money increases the money available to buy food or the existence of adequate road infrastructure may lead to decreased food prices. These direct effects all lead to a common intermediate effect, which is better ability of households to acquire healthy and nutritious food. The acquisition of healthy food is dependent on there being food available. Being able to acquire healthy food makes it easier for households to make healthy food choices, which in turn influences their intake of healthy and safe food. This represents the interaction across the different dimensions of food security. When the intermediate effects across all dimensions of food security are in place \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that is, when nutritious food is commonly available in sufficient quantities at fair prices \u00e2\u0080\u0093 households are able to acquire healthy food, all individuals within the household can eat healthy food that meets their nutritional requirements as well as their preferences, and long\u00e2\u0080\u0090term outcomes of food and nutrition security, and thus of improved nutritional status of everyone in the household and in the community, are achievable. One potentially harmful unintended consequence of interventions that improve access to food is the increased risk of overweight or obesity (Cotta 2013; Ruel 2013), particularly if there is increased intake of energy\u00e2\u0080\u0090dense ultraprocessed products and sugar\u00e2\u0080\u0090sweetened beverages (Lignani 2011). People may choose to acquire these foods because of lower cost; lack of knowledge about healthy diets; or other social, cultural or individual preferences (Ruel 2013). Although we are assessing interventions addressing access to food, it is important to note that, in order to have long\u00e2\u0080\u0090term food and nutrition security, all three dimensions need to be in place: food needs to be available; people need to be able to access it; and they also need to know how to choose the food, prepare and store it appropriately (Pinstrup\u00e2\u0080\u0090Andersen 2009; WHO 2013). Why it is important to do this review Although many interventions are being implemented to address food insecurity globally, the lack of sufficient improvements in levels of undernutrition over time, particularly in LMICs, highlights the need for the effectiveness of these interventions to be assessed. Furthermore, our scoping review highlighted that existing reviews addressing access to food in LMICs were not of high methodological quality. Therefore, we aimed to apply rigorous Cochrane Review methods to produce a high\u00e2\u0080\u0090quality review to identify effective interventions addressing food access. This evidence would then inform relevant stakeholders' decisions about which interventions to implement in order to achieve desirable results and ensure that scarce resources are utilised efficiently. Furthermore, improving access to food would help improve overall food security and the health and nutritional status of populations, which are requisites for the socioeconomic development of individuals and societies (FAO 2003). Objectives Primary objective To determine the effects of community\u00e2\u0080\u0090level interventions that aim to improve access to nutritious food in LMICs, for both the whole community and for disadvantaged or at\u00e2\u0080\u0090risk individuals or groups within a community, such as infants, children and women; elderly, poor or unemployed people; or minority groups. Secondary objectives To determine the features of community\u00e2\u0080\u0090level interventions that enable or impair the effective implementation of these interventions to improve access to food. To identify unintended consequences of interventions to improve access to food.",

    "METHODS": "Methods Criteria for considering studies for this review Types of studies We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster randomised controlled trials (cRCTs). We also included non\u00e2\u0080\u0090randomised studies because: 1. we did not expect to find many RCTs that would answer our question; and 2. to increase the external validity of the review findings. In these studies, observations are made before and after an intervention has been implemented or an exposure has occurred, both in an intervention and a control group. These types of studies are sometimes referred to as prospective analytical cohort studies or controlled before\u00e2\u0080\u0090after studies. We collectively termed them prospective controlled studies (PCS). We planned to include interrupted time series (ITS), but found none. ITS studies observe the effects of an intervention at multiple time points before and after an intervention. ITS studies needed to have at least three time points both before and after the intervention in order to be included. Types of participants We included all population groups living in communities in LMICs exposed to community\u00e2\u0080\u0090level interventions aiming to improve food access. For the purpose of this review, we defined a community as a group of people with diverse characteristics who are linked by social ties, share common perspectives and engage in joint action in geographical locations or settings (MacQueen 2001). We included both adults and children living in those communities, as well as disadvantaged groups within those communities. LMICs were defined according to the World Bank 2020. Most interventions addressing food insecurity are usually implemented in areas and among populations at high risk for food insecurity, such as low\u00e2\u0080\u0090income areas, unemployed people, women and children. We did not restrict studies on the basis of social and demographic characteristics, and reported these characteristics in the review. We excluded studies which only included participants with specific diseases or conditions (e.g. severely malnourished children) as these types of participants require specialised approaches to address malnutrition caused by these diseases or conditions. Types of interventions We included community\u00e2\u0080\u0090level interventions that aim to improve access to food, as detailed in our logic model (Figure 1). Community\u00e2\u0080\u0090level interventions were defined as those in which the community was the setting where the intervention was implemented, with every member of that community potentially benefiting from it (McLeroy 2003). This includes interventions that are district\u00e2\u0080\u0090, city\u00e2\u0080\u0090 or village\u00e2\u0080\u0090wide or interventions that take place within community institutions such as schools, neighbourhoods, churches or work sites. The intervention may involve individuals, households, organisations or public policy. Based on the literature in this field, and on the findings of our scoping review, we decided to include the following interventions that address access to food (Table 8): interventions that improve buying power (e.g. income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation opportunities, cash transfer schemes); interventions addressing food prices (e.g. policies, discounts, vouchers and subsidies); interventions addressing infrastructure and transport that affect physical access to food outlets; interventions addressing the social environment and social support (e.g. social support from family, neighbours or government). We included studies that compared these interventions, individually or in combination, to no intervention or to other eligible interventions, including treatment as usual. We chose this broad approach because we did not expect to find many eligible studies to include for each of the intervention types. As we anticipated variability in the duration of included interventions, we included interventions of any duration. Although we were interested in interventions that have measured access to nutritious food, we did not apply this as an inclusion criterion. Instead, we captured this information when extracting the details of included interventions, if this was available. We excluded interventions that addressed transient food insecurity (e.g. food aid during natural disasters and wars) and that provided short\u00e2\u0080\u0090term relief from food insecurity (e.g. one\u00e2\u0080\u0090off food voucher, food banks or soup kitchens). We also excluded interventions that provided food in the form of food baskets or in\u00e2\u0080\u0090kind transfers of food. These types of interventions, according to our logic model, fall under the groups of interventions addressing availability and were, therefore, excluded. Other types of in\u00e2\u0080\u0090kind transfers (e.g. livestock, food vouchers, etc), that were not directly providing food to participants but contributed to their economic access to food, were eligible for inclusion. Interventions that involved agricultural production also typically fall under 'food availability', however, if their aim was specifically to generate income, they were included. Types of outcome measures Given the complex nature of food security, we assessed outcomes at different levels, namely at the community, household and individual levels. The findings of our scoping review showed that the types of outcomes measured across food security interventions vary considerably. For this reason, we took a broad approach regarding the outcomes to include. Given that our main interest was in determining whether these interventions improve access to food and, consequently, food security and nutritional status, we included only interventions that had measured outcomes related to food access or nutritional status, or that used a food security measurement tool. We included any study that had at least one of the outcomes listed below. Primary outcomes Our primary outcomes included those that measure access to food at the household and community level. Following from our logic model, these were the following changes in the (FAO 2013; Smith 2006): prevalence of undernourishment (i.e. proportion of people with insufficient intake to meet minimum dietary energy requirements (MDER) (); proportion of household expenditure on food (as proportion of household income or of total household expenditure); proportion of households who were food secure (e.g. according to various measures or indices of food security and dietary diversity at an individual or household level), as measured in the included study. Secondary outcomes Secondary outcomes were those that reflect access to food and food availability and utilisation. Thus, they reflect nutritional status, which is the ultimate goal of food security interventions at the individual level. Following from our logic model, the secondary outcomes at the individual level were: change in adequacy of dietary intake (e.g. food or energy intake and whether it meets energy and nutrient requirements; if intake was not assessed for adequacy, i.e. only calories reported, this was not reported in the review); change in anthropometric indicators (e.g. stunting, wasting and underweight in children, according to height, weight, height\u00e2\u0080\u0090for\u00e2\u0080\u0090age z\u00e2\u0080\u0090scores (HAZ), weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090for\u00e2\u0080\u0090height z\u00e2\u0080\u0090scores (WHZ), and weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090for\u00e2\u0080\u0090age z\u00e2\u0080\u0090scores (WAZ); underweight and overweight in adults according to body mass index (BMI) classifications); change in biochemical indicators (e.g. micronutrient levels in the blood); cognitive function and development during the intervention period (e.g. Denver Developmental Screening Test, Bayley Scales of Infant Development); change in proportion of anxiety or depression (as described by the included study's authors); morbidity (as described by the review authors); adverse outcomes (e.g. proportion overweight or obese as a potentially harmful consequence of these type of interventions). We only included outcomes that were measured at least three months after the intervention was implemented as outcomes measured earlier are not likely to reflect sustainable changes. Search methods for identification of studies Electronic searches We searched electronic databases from 1980 onwards for relevant studies. We applied no language or publication status limits. We chose the year 1980 as the starting point because it was around this time that the term 'food security', encompassing access to food, started being used (Masset 2011). The initial searches were conducted in September 2016 in the following databases: Ovid MEDLINE(R) Epub Ahead of Print 11 July 2016, Ovid MEDLINE 1946 to June week 5 2016, Ovid MEDLINE(R) In\u00e2\u0080\u0090Process & Other Non\u00e2\u0080\u0090Indexed Citations 11 July 2016, Ovid MEDLINE Daily Update 11 July 2016; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL): Issue 6, 2016 (the Cochrane Library/Wiley); Embase (Elsevier); GreenFILE (EBSCO); AfricaBib (africabib.org); AGRIS; AGRICOLA; AFRICAN HEALTHLINE, African Journals Online (via Africa\u00e2\u0080\u0090Wide Information, EBSCO); Trials Register of Promoting Health Interventions (TRoPHI); WHO Global Index Medicus; Web of Science (Conference Proceedings Citation Index, Science Citation Index Expanded, Social Science Citation Index); Sociological Abstracts (ProQuest); International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS) (ProQuest); Global Health (EBSCO); ClinicalTrials.gov; WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. A combination of text words and controlled vocabulary terms related to the interventions and possible outcome measures were used to develop a sensitive search strategy. The search strategies for the different databases are available in Appendix 1, which is an adaptation of the search strategy for the Cochrane Review assessing interventions to improve food security in developed countries (Burns 2010). We applied a study design filter to the search that has been developed by Joy Oliver, the information specialist at Cochrane South Africa. The original search strategy for MEDLINE published with the protocol of this review had to be revised by a librarian and adapted for Ovid MEDLINE, as it retrieved an excessive number of results. The Ovid MEDLINE search strategy was then modified to be adapted for the other databases and reported as appendices in our full review. We recruited the Cochrane Public Health Group's information specialist to advise on and implement the search strategy. The search was updated in April 2019 and February 2020. For the updates, we followed the recommendations of Garner 2016. The Cochrane Public Health Group's information specialist defined a minimum set of databases that would have identified the original included studies and optimised the remaining database searches to improve the balance of sensitivity and precision of the search strategies. We searched the following databases from 1980 onwards: Ovid MEDLINE(R) and Epub Ahead of Print, In\u00e2\u0080\u0090Process & Other Non\u00e2\u0080\u0090Indexed Citations, Daily and Versions; CENTRAL (the Cochrane Library/Wiley); Web of Science (Conference Proceedings Citation Index, Science Citation Index Expanded, Social Science Citation Index); Global Health (EBSCO); Sociological Abstracts (ProQuest); International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. The search strategies for each database included in the latest search, which is the same as for the April 2019 search, are available in Appendix 1. Appendix 2 presents the search strategies of the original search strategy in September 2016. Some of the electronic databases specified above index a combination of published and unpublished studies, such as doctoral thesis and conference abstracts. Therefore, the electronic searches captured some of the unpublished studies. For further searching for unpublished studies, see Searching other resources. Searching other resources We identified additional studies through searching reference lists of similar reviews or contacting authors of included studies. However, much of the additional searches we were planning to undertake at the protocol stage were not carried out. We provide reasons in the Differences between protocol and review section. Data collection and analysis Selection of studies Two author pairs (SD, AS, MV, AB, JO, VR, BS) independently screened all titles and abstracts retrieved to determine eligibility against the inclusion criteria. Full\u00e2\u0080\u0090text copies of eligible titles and of those for which eligibility was unclear were retrieved for closer examination. Any disagreements regarding eligibility were resolved through discussion or through arbitration by a third author, if necessary. We recorded the reasons for excluding studies at the full\u00e2\u0080\u0090text screening stage in the Characteristics of excluded studies table. We completed a PRISMA flow chart of study selection. The initial title and abstract screening, from the first search, was carried out using Word documents. The full\u00e2\u0080\u0090text screening and all subsequent screening was carried out using the Covidence platform. Where we found relevant studies in a language other than English, Portuguese or Spanish, we planned to contact Cochrane Public Health for options for translations. We found studies in French, which a colleague reviewed against the eligibility criteria. As these were not eligible for inclusion, no translations were required. We found no studies in any other language that required translation. We used EndNote X8 to manage the retrieved records and to remove duplicate reports of the same study. The study was considered the unit and all references related to the same study were grouped under the same identifier. Data extraction and management For each included study, author pairs (SD, AS, MV, AB, JO, VR, BS) extracted data independently and resolved disagreements through discussion or arbitration by a third author. We collected all data except those concerning outcomes using Covidence, using a standardised data collection form, which was piloted on two studies. One author extracted outcomes data using a standardised and piloted form in Microsoft Excel 2007 and a second author (a biostatistician; YB) checked all the data extracted. We based our data extraction form on the forms from Cochrane Public Health and Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC), modified to suit our review. We extracted the following data. Study design and methods (recruitment of participants, representativeness of sample, number of intervention groups, randomisation procedure, statistical methods). Details about the participants, including PROGRESS\u00e2\u0080\u0090Plus characteristics and number in each group at baseline and at the endpoint. PROGRESS\u00e2\u0080\u0090Plus characteristics refer to characteristics of participants that can be used to identify disadvantaged groups and that allow us to differentiate the effects of the intervention across social categories (Tugwell 2010). These characteristics include: place of residence, race or ethnicity, occupation, gender, religion, education, socioeconomic status and social capital; and Plus characteristics include age). We extracted details about withdrawals and dropouts, if these were available. Details about the intervention, including process measures (e.g. aims; social and cultural context; comparison interventions; length of the intervention; duration of follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up; implementation factors such as amount of conditional cash transfers, number of times transport is given or total amount of food vouchers given to each individual), and whether the intervention was universal or targeted. This information aimed to provide insight on the factors that may impair or facilitate implementation of the intervention, which addresses the second objective of this review. We also extracted information on whether the intervention aimed to improve access to nutritious food, how nutritious food was defined, if specific nutritious foods were targeted for increased access and what types of food were accessed by participants. Description of outcomes used to measure effectiveness and how they were measured. Primary outcomes at the household and community level. Secondary outcomes at the individual level. Other process measures including intervention cost and sustainability. Source of study funding and sponsorship of the interventions. We incorporated the Cochrane\u00e2\u0080\u0090Campbell Methods Group Equity Checklist into our data extraction form (); however, the included studies reported very little of this information. We extracted information on potential confounders or moderators of the study outcomes. These included sociodemographic variables such as gender, ethnicity or race, and place of residence, and other PROGRESS\u00e2\u0080\u0090Plus characteristics based on the details available in the studies. When necessary, we contacted the authors of primary studies to for clarification or to seek missing information. We used Review Manager 2014 for data management and analysis. Assessment of risk of bias in included studies Author pairs (SD, AS, MV, AB, JO, VR, BS) conducted the risk of bias assessment and resolved disagreements through discussion or arbitration by a third author. Risk of bias assessments were also carried out in Covidence. We assessed the risk of bias for all RCTs and PCS using the EPOC risk of bias tool for studies with a separate control group (EPOC 2017). This tool assesses the same risk of bias domains as the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool for RCTs (Higgins 2011), namely sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessors, incomplete outcome data (including loss of clusters in the case of cRCTs), selective outcome reporting and other bias. It also includes additional domains to assess the risk of bias from inappropriate methods regarding: similarity of baseline outcome measurements, similarity of baseline characteristics and whether the study was protected against contamination. For other bias, we specifically assessed misclassification bias of the exposure, measurement bias and two domains related to cRCTs: incorrect analysis (i.e. whether the study adjusted for clustering) and recruitment bias. We assessed the risk of bias from lack of blinding of participants and personnel and of outcome assessors separately. We had planned to assess the risk of bias from lack of blinding separately for objective and subjective outcomes and to assess the risk of bias from incomplete outcome data separately for different outcomes. However, given the disparity and multiplicity of outcomes reported, we decided not to do this. However, we did consider whether the outcome was objective or subjective when assessing the risk of bias from lack of blinding. We had planned to use the EPOC risk of bias tool for ITS study designs; however, we included no ITS studies. For each item, we made a judgement of 'High risk', 'Unclear risk', or 'Low risk', with supportive information to justify these judgements provided in the Characteristics of included studies table. We incorporated the risk of bias assessment in the interpretation of our review findings, and we did not restrict analysis by degree of risk of bias. We presented a 'Risk of bias' graph and a summary figure. To assess overall risk of bias at study level, we considered its risk of bias for two key domains: selection and attrition bias. For example, if a study was classified at high risk of either selection or attrition bias, it was classified as having overall high risk of bias. Measures of treatment effect Where data allowed, we conducted meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis using Review Manager 5 (Review Manager 2014). However, due to sparsely reported data, we were unable to conduct a meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis in many instances. For binary outcomes, we planned to report the risk ratio (RR) of outcomes in the intervention group compared to the control group. Only one included study reported the RR as an overall effect measure for the intervention. The other 28 included studies that reported dichotomous outcomes reported the change in proportion using percentage points (pp) (68%) or using reported odds ratios (OR) (32%). For continuous outcomes, and where baseline data were available, we reported the mean difference (MD) between the change in the intervention and control groups if the outcomes had been measured in the same way by all studies. If the continuous outcomes were measured in distinct ways in different studies in a comparison, we used the standardised mean difference (SMD) between the intervention and control groups. Where the change per group was not available, we used end values where randomisation was successful. If there was a reasonable risk of selection bias, and the change per group was not available, the study was not included in a meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis. The included studies reported mostly estimates from regression or from difference\u00e2\u0080\u0090in\u00e2\u0080\u0090difference analyses, which were interpretable as an MD and thus were reported as such. None of the studies reported the effects per group, and in most cases the data were only available either for baseline or endline, and if it was available, often there was no measure of variance reported. Thus, we described the effect measures as reported in the included studies. We reported 95% confidence intervals (CIs) alongside all effect estimates, when these were available or when it was possible to calculate them. Calculations of 95% CI were done in Review Manager (using the inverse variance option; Review Manager 2014) or using a Microsoft Excel 2007 spreadsheet with the formula to calculate the 95% CI from the regression estimate and standard error (SE) value. We report P values only where no 95% CI was reported or could be calculated to illustrate the strength of evidence for the effect size. Unit of analysis issues cRCTs that randomise groups rather than individuals to intervention groups and that report analyses at the individual level needed to also report the method used to account for clustering. A biostatistician (YB) checked all studies to ensure that the clustering effect had been accounted for correctly. If they had not taken the clustering effect into account in their analyses, we would have requested individual participant data, calculated an intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC), and re\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysed the data appropriately. If we had been unable to obtain primary data, we would have attempted to find an appropriate ICC from the literature and adjust the sample size accordingly. We had planned to meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analyse the effect estimates and SEs from cRCTs using generic inverse\u00e2\u0080\u0090variance methods in Review Manager 2014. If we had re\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysed the data, we would have clearly marked the results as re\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysed and we would have stated where re\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis had not been possible. However, we did not have to re\u00e2\u0080\u0090analyse the data for included cRCTs as they all correctly accounted for clustering. In cases where the outcomes were measured at multiple time points, we had planned to group the outcomes measured at similar time points where this was possible. For any particular outcome, if most studies were reporting a specific time point and only one study reported multiple time points, we reported the most commonly reported time point. In most cases, the time points were similar and, for the few instances where this was not the case, we extracted measures from all time points but reported the latest time point. Taking into account that the minimum duration after implementation at which we extracted outcomes was three months, the short\u00e2\u0080\u0090term time point was three to six months. We only considered outcomes reported immediately at the end of the intervention, not postintervention follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up. In many cases, studies reported multiple outcome measures for the same outcome domains. To prioritise the outcomes, we selected the measure that provided the largest scale measure of the domain (i.e. the most comprehensive outcome). For example, in cases where individual and composite measures for the same outcome domain were reported for the same study, we preferentially reported composite measures as these are probably more useful to decision\u00e2\u0080\u0090makers. For anthropometry, we did not report effects on weight and height units, but rather reported z\u00e2\u0080\u0090scores for weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090for\u00e2\u0080\u0090age and height\u00e2\u0080\u0090for\u00e2\u0080\u0090age, in which weight and height are assessed against a reference standard. All outcomes reported in a study are presented in the Characteristics of included studies table, as well as an indication of which were selected for synthesis. For interventions with multiple comparison groups, all groups that met this review's inclusion criteria were included. If there were more than two relevant comparison groups for the same intervention, we attempted to combine the relevant experimental and control groups to make a single pairwise comparison. This was the case in three studies, for which two interventions groups were combined. If this was not possible, we made multiple pairwise comparisons between the relevant groups and divided the sample size of the shared intervention group evenly across the comparisons to avoid double counting of participants in a meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis. If a meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis was not possible and we could not combine the results of different groups, we presented the results of all relevant groups. Dealing with missing data If there were unclear or missing data related to study methodology, participants lost to follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up, outcome data or statistics, we contacted the study's primary author via email. We recorded all communications with authors in Appendix 3. We recorded all missing outcome data in the data extraction form and in the Characteristics of included studies table. If it was not possible to obtain missing outcome information after attempting to do so, we would have excluded these studies from the meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis. We did not exclude any studies due to missing outcome data. Five included studies did not report the number analysed for at least one outcome (for which the number (n) is stated as not reported (NR)) (Ahmed 2019a; Ahmed 2019b; Andaleeb 2016; Ferre 2014; Hoddinott 2013). This lack of reporting reduces our confidence in the estimated treatment effect as we are unable to assess if the study was powered to detect an effect, analysed accounting for any clustering or if attrition bias was likely. In addition, it has been shown that trial sample sizes can influence treatment effect, with smaller studies reporting larger effect estimates (Dechartres 2013). With no sample sizes reported, it is difficult to ascertain whether this bias exists. Assessment of heterogeneity Where we were able to meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analyse, we assessed heterogeneity, or the variability among the studies included in a meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis, by visual inspection of overlap of CIs, and by assessing statistical heterogeneity with the Chi2 statistic (P < 0.1) (Deeks 2019). We calculated the I2 statistic to quantify heterogeneity; with an I2 statistic of 75% and above indicating substantial heterogeneity. We also calculated Tau2, which reflects the extent of variation among intervention effects in different studies, to assess heterogeneity (Deeks 2019). However, in most cases, we were unable to carry out meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analyses or create forest plots due to heterogeneity. Instead, we assessed clinical, methodological and conceptual heterogeneity, through tabulation of characteristics of studies included in the same synthesis. For specific comparisons and outcomes, we assessed clinical or conceptual heterogeneity by considering variability in the participants and interventions, or co\u00e2\u0080\u0090interventions, including study duration, intervention dosing and outcome assessment. We assessed methodological heterogeneity by considering the variability in study design and risk of bias (Deeks 2019; Singh 2017). Assessment of reporting biases We had planned to assess the likelihood of reporting bias through funnel plots for each outcome with 10 or more included studies in a meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis (Sterne 2019). We would have assessed the funnel plots visually for sources of asymmetry, such as small\u00e2\u0080\u0090study effects, publication bias or other. If it was likely that asymmetry was caused by small\u00e2\u0080\u0090study effects, we would have conducted sensitivity analysis to explore how this affected the results and conclusions of the meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis. However, we were unable to do this as none of the compared outcomes were assessed by at least 10 studies. Data synthesis In most cases, we were unable to include all studies reporting a specific outcome domain in a meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis. This was due to studies reporting multiple measures for the same domain that could not be combined, either because there was missing information regarding variance measures, or because the effect measures reported could not be converted to a standardised metric. Therefore, we synthesised the data from all studies reporting on the same outcome domain using vote counting based on the effect direction method (McKenzie 2019). The results of individual studies were presented in one of four categories: 1. 'favours control' if the point estimate favoured the control and the 95% CI did not cross the null; 2. 'unclear effect; potentially favouring the control' if the point estimate favoured the control but the 95% CI crossed the null; 3. 'unclear effect; potentially favouring the intervention' if the point estimate favoured the intervention and the 95% CI crossed the null; and 4. 'favours intervention' if the point estimate favoured the intervention and the 95% CI did not cross the null. Where no CI was provided or could be calculated, we decided whether the effects were 'clear' or 'unclear' based on provided P values. However, P values did not inform the effect direction reported. Although this is a useful method to synthesise data when meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis is not possible, there are some limitations associated with this method, for example, it does not provide information on the magnitude of effects, does not account for differences in the relative sizes of the studies and is a less powerful method than that used to combine P values (McKenzie 2019). Regarding the effect direction synthesis, we reported the number of studies with results in the different effect categories for each outcome domain, and the probability of observing this based on the multinomial distribution (for outcome domains with two or more studies and assuming the true proportion is 0.25 for all categories). This information was reported in the first paragraph reporting results for a specific outcome in the effects of interventions section. If a meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis of all studies in the outcome domain was possible, the multinomial distribution P value was not reported. To visually display the results for key outcomes included in the 'Summary of findings' tables, we created harvest plots for each comparison. These harvest plots depict data both from RCTs and from PCS for key summary of findings outcomes. We presented the results of the effect direction synthesis separately for RCTs and for PCS, in the Effects of interventions section. In some instances, we were able to carry out a meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis, either for all studies reporting on the same outcome measure (n = 35), or for a subset of studies that could be combined in a meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis (n = 8). We conducted meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analyses in Review Manager 2014 if the included studies were sufficiently homogeneous (I2 < 75%) and if there was a minimum of two studies for any type of intervention being compared reporting the same outcome measure. Not pooling results in cases of high heterogeneity is an accepted approach in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Deeks 2019). We also explored heterogeneity and reported this when there was high heterogeneity. We did not have sufficient data to carry out any subgroup analysis or meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090regression to more formally explore heterogeneity. We carried out meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analyses separately for each outcome and type of study design, and we used the random\u00e2\u0080\u0090effects model for all analyses to account for any existing heterogeneity. We generated forest plots for each comparison and outcome where meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analyses could be carried out (see Data and analyses). In preparation for synthesis, we first grouped all studies assessing the same intervention categories to identify which studies could be grouped under each preplanned comparison, and no changes to prespecified grouping were required. The comparison groups were based on the pre\u00e2\u0080\u0090specified types of interventions listed in table 2: cash transfers (unconditional; conditional), income generation interventions, food vouchers, food subsidies, and social support interventions. Under each comparison, we tabulated the available data and time frames reported for each outcome, which helped identify what data were available, and thus where meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis was possible and where we had to synthesise using effect direction. A meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis was possible if the effect and variance estimates were available for all studies or could be calculated from the available data, and if all effect estimates were of the same type (e.g. OR or MD) or could be converted for the comparison (e.g. OR to SMD). Where necessary, we converted OR to SMD, MD to SMD, or MD to SMD to OR. We prepared two additional types of tables to aid visualisation of available data. One was the 'Overview of included studies' table, summarising main characteristics and reported outcomes of included studies for each comparison (McKenzie 2019). In this table, we organised studies first by study design, with RCTs first followed by PCS, and second according to their overall risk of bias (low, unclear and then high risk of bias). The second type were tables with the results for individual studies, for each comparison, for scrutiny by the reader. The studies in these tables were also ordered according to their overall risk of bias. We had planned to assess and discuss the implementation factors common to effective interventions, if this information was reported in included studies or in published process evaluations that are mentioned in the study report. However, there was insufficient information from included studies on this. Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity We did not have enough data per outcome and comparison to carry out subgroup analyses. If data allowed, we would have conducted subgroup analysis to assess effectiveness for people at different levels of disadvantage. In updates of this review, we will include the following subgroups. Geographic location (e.g. urban versus rural, country or region). Sex (male versus female). Age (e.g. elderly people, adults, children, infants). Baseline nutritional status (e.g. underweight, overweight, micronutrient deficiencies). We would also have assessed important implementation factors through subgroups analyses, including the following. Intensity of intervention (high intensity versus low intensity, e.g. in relation to amount of food vouchers or of conditional cash transfers). Length of study and follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up (e.g. three to six months, more than six months to less than two years, and two years and beyond). Whether the intervention specifically aimed to improve access to nutritious food. These analyses would have allowed further exploration of heterogeneity. In order to compare the different subgroups with each other, we would have conducted a standard heterogeneity test in Review Manager 2014 across the subgroup results, by calculating the I2 statistic. We would have made sure that the subgroup data being compared were independent. Sensitivity analysis We conducted a sensitivity analysis to assess risk of bias for outcomes with five or more studies. Studies with overall low risk of bias were included in the sensitivity analysis. We reported the results of study designs separately. Summary of findings and assessment of the certainty of the evidence The 'Summary of findings' tables include information regarding the number of participants and studies for key outcomes, a summary of the intervention effect and a measure of the certainty of evidence for each outcome according to GRADE considerations. GRADE is a system of rating certainty of evidence in systematic reviews (Guyatt 2010). We rated the overall certainty of evidence for a particular outcome on\u00e2\u0080\u0090line with GRADEpro as high, moderate, low or very low. All RCTs started at high\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence and the following factors were considered to downgrade the certainty: overall risk of bias, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias. All PCS started at low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence and the following factors would have been considered to upgrade the certainty: large magnitude of effect, dose\u00e2\u0080\u0090response gradient and effect of plausible residual confounding. We did not upgrade the certainty of evidence for PCS as there were existing reasons for downgrading (Sch\u00c3\u00bcnemann 2019). As most of the evidence was not from pooled data, we used the 'Summary of findings' table format for narrative synthesis. We had planned to include a 'Summary of findings' table for the primary outcomes of this review. However, we decided to also include some of the secondary outcomes. The choice of outcome categories and specific outcome measures to report in the 'Summary of findings' table were decided by the review author team through in\u00e2\u0080\u0090depth discussion until consensus was reached, taking into consideration which outcomes would be useful to decision\u00e2\u0080\u0090makers. The 'Summary of findings' tables included the following outcomes. Prevalence of undernourishment. Proportion of household expenditure on food. Proportion of households who were food secure. Dietary diversity. Stunting. Wasting. Cognitive function and development. Three authors met to rate the evidence per outcome for each of the 'Summary of findings' tables. Decisions about whether to downgrade or not were made through discussion and reaching consensus. Evidence on different outcomes was available from different study designs. Where there was evidence for a particular outcome from both RCTs and PCS, we reported the data from the RCTs in the 'Summary of findings' table. When there were no data from RCTs for a particular outcome, we reported data from PCS that reported that outcome. We reported the certainty of the evidence in the Effects of interventions for outcomes which assessed with GRADE. For other outcomes, we report the risk of bias, as an indicator of the certainty of the evidence to consider when interpreting the findings. Appendix 4. Sensitivity analysis for outcomes with five or more studies Data and analyses Characteristics of studies Characteristics of included studies [ordered by study ID] Characteristics of excluded studies [ordered by study ID] Characteristics of studies awaiting classification [ordered by study ID] Characteristics of ongoing studies [ordered by study ID] Differences between protocol and review Although we aimed to follow the methods prespecified in our protocol (Durao 2015), we implemented some necessary changes to methods as we worked on the review. The changes and the reasons for them are detailed below. We had specified in the protocol that we would include non\u00e2\u0080\u0090randomised studies including controlled before\u00e2\u0080\u0090after studies (CBAs) and prospective analytical cohort studies. However, after identification of eligible studies, it was difficult to clearly identify the distinction between these two study designs; in both study designs, observations are made before and after an intervention has been implemented or an exposure has occurred, both in an intervention and a control group. They also have similar issues regarding potential biases due to using non\u00e2\u0080\u0090randomised methods, such as selection bias. Therefore, we made a pragmatic decision to keep these studies in the same category, namely 'prospective controlled studies'. A number of databases proposed in the protocol were removed from the initial search in 2016, as they were redundant, the content was not relevant or we did not have access to the databases. They are listed below, with reasons: Cochrane Public Health Group Specialized Register: included in CENTRAL; African Index Medicus: included in African Healthline; CINAHL (via EBSCOhost), PsycINFO: not relevant to the topic; Food Science and Technology Abstracts, CAB Abstracts: no access. After the evaluating the 2016 search results regarding number of relevant and eligible articles retrieved by each database, the following databases were omitted from the 2019 update of the search: Embase (Elsevier); GreenFILE (EBSCO); AfricaBib (africabib.org); AGRIS; AGRICOLA; AFRICAN HEALTHLINE, African Journals Online (via Africa\u00e2\u0080\u0090Wide Information, EBSCO); Trials Register of Promoting Health Interventions (TRoPHI); WHO Global Index Medicus; International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS) (ProQuest); ClinicalTrials.gov. In the protocol, we had planned to also search the top five journals in which the included studies are most frequently published and to contact the authors of included studies and undertake citation tracking of these studies, as well as handsearch reference lists of identified relevant systematic reviews. These additional steps to identify studies were not undertaken. Our search of electronic databases was very comprehensive and already retrieved a very large yield to screen. This made it unfeasible to handsearch individual journals. The electronic database search included grey literature databases and we found many reports from organisations working in this field, that are not from peer\u00e2\u0080\u0090reviewed journals. Therefore, we considered that the results retrieved from the search conducted was likely to identify all relevant articles. We had planned that one review author would initially screen the first batch of search results for obviously irrelevant titles, as a way to manage the large number of results expected. This was not done as, after the initial search was revised, the number of records retrieved were manageable for duplicate screening. We had planned to search the reference lists of the included studies for other relevant studies, and to search for unpublished studies in the grey literature database OpenGREY and on websites of relevant organisations, such as Eldis, International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), World Bank, Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN) and Science Development Net. However, given that electronic database searches already included sources of unpublished literature, and given the very high number of search results, we decided not to search these databases. It is important to note that results from the electronic database searching did retrieve reports published by the World Bank and IFPRI, for example, therefore, we believe we have not missed important studies by not carrying out this additional searching of grey literature databases or websites of relevant organisations. We had planned to contact experts working in various areas related to food security for relevant studies. However, given the number of results retrieved, of both published and unpublished studies, we did not think it was necessary to carry this out. We did contact authors of included studies, who sometimes sent other papers linked to a study identified through the search strategy. We had planned to meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analyse as our main synthesis method. Due to unavailability of relevant data from many studies we had to use other synthesis methods, namely vote counting based on effect direction. We added a clarification that we also excluded interventions where food was provided in the form of food baskets or in\u00e2\u0080\u0090kind transfers of food. These types of interventions, according to our logic model, fall under the groups of interventions addressing availability and were, therefore, excluded. We used a definition (that was not included in the protocol) for overall risk of bias to facilitate decisions for downgrading the evidence during our GRADE assessment. We also selected the key outcomes for the GRADE 'Summary of findings' tables after the protocol was published.",
    "DISCUSS": "Discussion Summary of main results Fifty\u00e2\u0080\u0090nine studies, addressing six intervention types, met the criteria for inclusion in this review. Some studies evaluated the same programme. None of the studies included assessed the primary outcome of prevalence of undernourishment. Sixteen cRCTs, two parallel\u00e2\u0080\u0090group RCTs and three PCS assessed UCTs. Available evidence indicates that UCTs improve food security (six RCTs) and make little or no difference to cognitive function and development (three RCTs) (high\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence); UCTs may increase dietary diversity (10 RCTs) and may reduce stunting (four RCTs) (low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence); and that the evidence regarding the effects of UCTs on the proportion of household expenditure on food (five RCTs) and wasting (four RCTs) is very uncertain (very low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence). Regarding adverse outcomes, evidence from one trial indicates that UCTs reduce the proportion of infants who are overweight. Nine cRCTs and five PCS assessed CCTs. None of these studies reported on food security measures. Available evidence indicates that CCTs result in little to no difference in the proportion of household expenditure on food (two RCTs) and that they slightly improve cognitive function in children (two RCTs) (high\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence); that CCTs probably slightly improve dietary diversity (two RCTs) (moderate\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence); and that they may make little to no difference to stunting (four RCTs) or wasting (two RCTs) (low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence). Evidence on adverse outcomes (two PCS) shows that CCTs make no different to the proportion of overweight children. Six cRCTs and 11 PCS assessed income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation interventions. None of these studies reported on cognitive function and development, or the proportion of household expenditure on food. Available evidence indicates that income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation interventions make little or no difference to stunting (two RCTs) or wasting (two RCTs) (moderate\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence); and that they may results in little to no difference to food security (two RCTs) and may improve dietary diversity in children but not for households (four RCTs) (low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence). Four trials reported on food vouchers. None reported on the proportion of households expenditure on food, food security, or cognitive function and development. Available evidence indicates that food vouchers probably reduce stunting (one RCT) (moderate\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence), and that they may improve dietary diversity slightly (two RCTs) and may result in little to no difference in wasting (one RCT) (low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence). One RCT and three PCS reported the effects offood and nutrition subsidies. None of these studies reported on food security, stunting, wasting, or cognitive function and development. Available evidence indicates that food and nutrition subsidies may improve dietary diversity among school children (one RCT) (low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence), and the evidence is very uncertain about the effects on household expenditure on healthy foods as a proportion of total expenditure on food (very low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence). One RCT and one PCS reported on the effects of social environment interventions. None of the studies reported on the proportion of household expenditure on food, or on cognitive function and development. Available evidence indicates that community grants probably make little to no difference to wasting (one RCT) (moderate\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence) and that they make little or no difference to stunting (one RCT) (low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence); and the evidence is very uncertain about the effects of VSLs on food security (one PCS) and dietary diversity (one PCS) (very low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence). Overall completeness and applicability of evidence We considered the differences between the evidence identified and our prespecified eligibility criteria, including relevant gaps identified with the harvest plots regarding outcomes with no data, when assessing the completeness and applicability of the evidence. Participants in included studies ranged from households to individuals, including adults and children. A few studies specifically targeted women as recipients of the intervention. Most studies targeted poor households, and mostly in rural areas, based on specific criteria to identify poor and vulnerable households. Although we had planned to assess effects within specific disadvantaged subgroups, this was not possible because of unclear reporting about these types of characteristics in the included studies. Our logic model showed that there is a wide range of interventions that could address access to food. Across all the possible interventions, we included mostly studies aiming to increase buying power, including UCTs, CCTs, and income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation interventions. Fewer studies addressed food prices and only two assessed social environment interventions, namely a community cash grant programme, and a VSLs programme. We found no studies assessing infrastructure interventions that aimed to improve physical access to food. Some of the studies we excluded from this review assessed some of these relevant interventions, but they were conducted in high\u00e2\u0080\u0090income countries. For example, one before\u00e2\u0080\u0090after study that assessed the implementation of a fruit and vegetable market in low\u00e2\u0080\u0090income neighbourhoods (Gorham 2015), which addressed lack of infrastructure; a randomised trial that assessed financial incentives to increase fruit and vegetable intake among participants in the USA Food Stamp programme (Olsho 2016), which addresses high food prices. This illustrates, perhaps, a lack of such interventions being implemented in LMIC settings. Regarding the variation in type and intensity of interventions, particularly of CCTs and how the conditions and the enforcement of these components vary across interventions, we were unable to distinguish which specific conditionalities were linked to the outcome based on available data. In these interventions, conditionalities ranged from attending clinic visits, educational sessions and school attendance. For other interventions such as income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation interventions, intervention components also varied significantly, and it is difficult to specify which intervention components are associated with the observed outcome. In majority of studies, the intervention was not compared with another intervention. For some larger studies of government programmes, such as cash transfers, it was common for a delayed control to be used as a comparator. In this case, the control group also received the intervention, but at a later stage, as it would be unethical to randomise communities to no intervention in these types of programmes. One issue with this was that many long\u00e2\u0080\u0090term outcomes were not eligible for reporting in this review as, by that time, both the intervention and control groups were receiving the intervention. In terms of outcomes, no included study reported on the primary outcome of prevalence of undernourishment. Prevalence of Undernourishment (PoU) is a national\u00e2\u0080\u0090level model\u00e2\u0080\u0090based indicator used to understand access to food in terms of dietary energy inadequacy and can be measured at national or household level (INDDEX Project 2018). It measures the percentage of the population whose dietary energy intake is below the MDER. In line with this, the adequacy of dietary intake at the individual level was also not reported in most studies, and only six studies reported this outcome. Most studies reported on actual energy intake (i.e. calories) or intake of specific nutrients (i.e. grams), without assessing this intake against some measure of adequacy, such as the DRIs. Besides these outcome categories, fewer studies reported on child cognitive function and development compared to other outcomes. We had intended to assess not only if adequacy of dietary intake improved, but also if diet quality increased. Included studies did not report on dietary quality (i.e. whether they were refined and high in saturated fat or healthier foods such as legumes, fruit and vegetables). However, many studies reported on dietary diversity, which is an approximate measure of diet quality. Greater dietary diversity should indicate better overall dietary quality, as it means that foods from more food groups are being consumed. For most outcomes, data were available at two and three years, so there is not much evidence on longer\u00e2\u0080\u0090term impact of included interventions. Only three studies reported on the adverse outcome of overweight and obesity. Due to the lack of information in many included studies, we were unable to address our first secondary objective \u00e2\u0080\u0093 to identify features of interventions that enable or impair the effective implementation. We believe this warrants a separate study assessing each intervention more in\u00e2\u0080\u0090depth and using different study designs, such as qualitative studies. Quality of the evidence We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach and presented our findings in a 'Summary of findings' table for each comparison. For all comparisons except comparison 6, the 'Summary of findings' tables included only data from RCTs, as there were data from at least one RCT for the key outcomes. The 'Summary of findings' tables for comparisons 5 and 6 include data from RCTs and PCS, as for specific outcomes there were no data from RCTs. For UCTs, the certainty of the evidence ranged from very low to high across outcomes. Reasons for downgrading included inconsistency due to wide variance of point estimates, imprecision due to wide CIs and due to high overall risk of bias. For CCTs, the certainty of the evidence ranged from low to high across outcomes. Reasons for downgrading included inconsistency due to wide variation in point estimates, high overall risk of bias and imprecision due to wide CIs. For income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation interventions, the certainty of the evidence ranged from low to moderate across outcomes. Reasons for downgrading included imprecision due to wide CIs, indirectness because the evidence was from a single study, high overall risk of bias and inconsistency due to wide variation in point estimates. The certainty of the evidence on food voucher interventions ranged from low to moderate across outcomes. Reasons for downgrading included high overall risk of bias, inconsistency as CIs had minimal overlap, indirectness as findings were from one single study and imprecision due to findings ranging from an important harm to important benefit. The certainty of the evidence on food and nutrition subsidies ranged from very low to low across outcomes. Reasons for downgrading included high overall risk bias and indirectness as the results were from a single study. For VSLs, the certainty of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. Reasons for downgrading included indirectness, as the results were from a single study, and imprecision, due to wide CIs. All but one included study was funded by a for\u00e2\u0080\u0090profit organisation and 66.1% did not report on potential COI. Potential biases in the review process We followed Cochrane Review methodology to prevent potential biases from being introduced into the review process. Nevertheless, potential biases could have been introduced due to the nature of subjective decisions that had to be made while conducting the review and because the protocol was outdated and new methods had emerged since its publication (Durao 2015). Multiple outcome measures concerning the same outcome category were reported across included studies. Since there is no guidance in the literature on what measures are considered as 'gold standard' for measuring food and nutrition security, we selected the most comprehensive or largest scale measure reported for the same outcome domain in the same study. For example, we reported changes in z\u00e2\u0080\u0090scores for height or weight but we did not report actual height (in centimetre) or weight (kilogram) measures. We judged changes in z\u00e2\u0080\u0090scores to be more useful and easier to interpret as they are assessing standardised height and weight attainment adjusted for age and sex. Still, multiplicity of outcome measures made it difficult to include all studies reporting the same outcome domain in meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analyses. We also could not include all studies in meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analyses due to incomplete reporting of the required data (e.g. variance measures). Therefore, we made post\u00e2\u0080\u0090hoc decisions about synthesising the evidence using vote counting based on effect direction, using harvest plots to visually illustrate the results. We used the point estimates and the 95% CI to decide how to categorise the effects of the studies. However, data for these were sometimes not available or could not be calculated, and thus we had to base decisions regarding whether the effect was clear or unclear based on the P value. As we had not prespecified the outcomes to be assessed using GRADE in the protocol (Durao 2015), we had to make this decision post\u00e2\u0080\u0090hoc. The author team discussed and agreed through consensus which outcomes we considered best for informing decision\u00e2\u0080\u0090making. However, it may be that another group could have made different decisions regarding which outcomes to highlight in the 'Summary of findings' tables. All outcomes are, however, reported in the review text and in the tables of individual results. We also had to prioritise outcome measures to report in the review as often there were multiple outcome measures reported in the same study for the same outcome domain. We attempted to prevent introduction of biases by selecting an approach that was independent of the effect measure reported (i.e. prioritising the most comprehensive outcome measure). Our interpretation of the primary outcome 'proportion of household expenditure on food' was based on Engel's Law \"\u00e2\u0080\u00a6according to which the household decreases its budget share of food as its income increases\". This is the interpretation used in one of the included studies (Brugh 2018). Not all included studies interpreted this outcome in the same way, with some interpreting an increase in this proportion as 'good' while others interpreting a decrease as 'good'. Furthermore, not all studies clearly interpreted their findings. This variability led us to interpret it based on Engel's law. While food expenditure is expected to increase with higher income, the proportion of expenditure on food in relation to other expenditure should decrease. The use of this approach may explain some of the diversity in effect measures observed for this outcome. Due to our high search yield we were unable to complement the electronic database search with screening reference lists of included studies, reference lists of identified relevant systematic reviews or websites of specific organisations, as planned. Thus, we may have missed some relevant studies. However, since our search was very comprehensive, we believe that the chance of this was small. One limitation of our review was that the synthesis was unable to draw conclusions about the mean effect size for many outcomes, due to limited availability of suitable data. However, we have tried to calculate all necessary information for meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis where this was possible. Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews Other recent reviews on food access tend to focus on individual interventions rather than on a comprehensive review of the evidence base of interventions addressing access to food like ours. We identified six published reviews among the results of the updated search for this review which addressed access to food or included similar interventions to those included in this review. Three reviews addressed cash transfers (Baird 2014; Hunter 2017; Melo 2016); two reviews evaluated interventions related to the income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation category (Bird 2019; Pullar 2018); two reviews focused on interventions addressing food prices (Mizdrak 2015; Alagiyawanna 2015); and one review addressed interventions addressing infrastructure, for which we did not find any studies to include in our review (Hsiao 2019). Of the reviews addressing cash transfers, two had a different focus to our review: one on the effect of cash transfers on educational outcomes (Baird 2014), and one on use and quality of maternity care services (Hunter 2017). The third review included 10 studies of cash transfer interventions in Latin America and reported a positive association of cash transfers with children's anthropometric status (Melo 2016). However, they also reported that improvements may differ by age and that the included studies, which varied in design, were of questionable methodological quality. Other systematic reviews on cash transfers had a different focus than that of our review; they assessed the effects of such interventions on improving infant vaccination (Munk 2019), women economic empowerment (Leite 2019), clinical outcomes for pulmonary tuberculosis (Richterman 2018), or social determinants of health (Owusu\u00e2\u0080\u0090Addo 2018). Of those that had a similar focus, some reported positive effects or no effects. One review of cash transfer programmes including different types of literature assessed the evidence of the impact of cash transfers on a range of individual\u00e2\u0080\u0090 or household\u00e2\u0080\u0090level outcomes in 201 included studies, of which 89 reported on health and nutrition outcomes, including the use of health services, dietary diversity and anthropometry (Bastagli 2016). They reported a greater proportion of significant results for dietary diversity than for anthropometric measures, but positive impacts in relation to the cash transfer interventions overall. Another review assessed universal and targeted UCTs and targeted CCTs and reported mostly positive effects of these interventions on birth weight, infant mortality, among other outcomes (Siddiqi 2018). Another review assessed the effects of CCTs on child health in LMICs (Owuso\u00e2\u0080\u0090Addo 2014), and included 16 studies predominantly from Latin America. The review authors reported that programmes improved nutritional status of children in intervention compared to control groups in terms of, for example, growth in height and weight, decreased chance of being underweight, and improved dietary intake of protein and vegetables. However, some of the programmes did not always find an effect on anthropometric outcomes such as childhood wasting or stunting. Of note, these two reviews included the same studies as this Cochrane Review. Therefore, it is perhaps unsurprising that their findings were similar to ours. In one Cochrane Review of UCTs for reducing poverty and vulnerabilities and its effects on health services use and health outcomes in LMICs, the authors also reported that UCTs had beneficial effects on food security and dietary diversity, with evidence certainty ranging from low to moderate, and uncertain effects on stunting due to very low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence (Pega 2017). Of the two reviews addressing income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation interventions, results were similar, with some potential positive effect on diet intake and diversity. Bird 2019 assessed agriculture interventions on nutrition outcomes in specific countries in South Asia (India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan and Afghanistan) where agriculture activities are major sources for the livelihoods of large sections of the population. They included six studies assessing interventions of provision of seeds, plants and training, or livestock and training, or both, and reported a positive impact on intermediate outcomes, such as diet quality and diversity, but mixed results regarding impact on nutritional outcomes, such as anthropometry and anaemia. No meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analyses were carried out due to high heterogeneity. Pullar 2018 assessed the effects of poverty reduction and development interventions on non\u00e2\u0080\u0090communicable disease (NCD) prevalence and risk. They included 29 studies, mostly of agricultural interventions, and reported limited methodological quality in included studies and high heterogeneity of outcome measures, similarly to our review. Included studies failed to measure and report on NCD prevalence and risk, but they reported that intensive agricultural interventions were associated with improved calorie, vitamin, fruit and vegetable intake, with the effects being dependent on other factors such as land ownership and infection status. However, the findings had poor generalisability because of small sample sizes and use of convenience samples of population with the highest need. Both reviews of interventions addressing food prices focused on obesity reduction and not on undernutrition. Alagiyawanna 2015 assessed the effects of fiscal interventions implemented at national or local levels to improve diets and reduce obesity, assessing effects on consumption and health outcomes in adults and children. They included 18 studies, mostly from high\u00e2\u0080\u0090income countries. Nine of these studies assessed the impact of taxes and these were all were from high\u00e2\u0080\u0090income countries. They reported that the effects of taxation of soft drinks and its consumption was mixed, as was the effect on BMI among children and adolescents. Existing taxation studies tend to be from high\u00e2\u0080\u0090income countries, which is likely the reason why we did not find any taxation\u00e2\u0080\u0090related studies to include in our review, which only focused on LMICs. Regarding subsidies, in high\u00e2\u0080\u0090income countries, Alagiyawanna 2015 reported positive associations with fruit and vegetable intake, maternal weight gain, increase in mean haemoglobin levels, consumption of healthy foods and height\u00e2\u0080\u0090for\u00e2\u0080\u0090age, but no association with BMI, low birthweight or fetal survival. One study in a low\u00e2\u0080\u0090 to middle\u00e2\u0080\u0090income country reported a negative association of subsidies with increased obesity. The Mizdrak 2015 review assessed fiscal interventions, but its scope was to specifically assess which personal characteristics influence differential impact of fiscal interventions, as this is considered a barrier to implementation. They included eight studies from high\u00e2\u0080\u0090income countries, reporting high heterogeneity between studies and population groups concerning the effects of fiscal measures on healthy diets. Although they reported that the evidence pointed towards a differential impact depending on personal characteristics, the data were limited and underpowered to detect effects according to personal characteristics. Hsiao 2019 assessed the barriers and facilitators of mobile produce markets in the US. This is a category of interventions for which we did not find studies to include in our review (i.e. infrastructure interventions), likely because these types of studies currently tend to be from high\u00e2\u0080\u0090income countries. They reported a positive association of mobile produce markets and fruit and vegetable intake, but noted that the quality of the evidence was problematic as the studies were found not to be rigorous in their design and had high potential for selection and other types of bias. An important aspect about this review is that it included interventions addressing upstream factors affecting access to food, that do not only rely on individual agency. This has been globally recognised as the best approach to address over\u00e2\u0080\u0090 and undernutrition, and cash transfers specifically are high on the agenda of many countries as they address the social determinants of health (Hawkes 2020; Owusu\u00e2\u0080\u0090Addo 2018). These types of interventions fall under the category of double duty actions that address both under\u00e2\u0080\u0090 and overnutrition at the same time, especially if complemented by education and behaviour change communication and regular check\u00e2\u0080\u0090ups as part of the intervention (Hawkes 2020).",
    "CONCL": "Authors' conclusions Implications for practice This review provides policy makers with a comprehensive evidence base, ranging from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to prospective controlled studies, evaluating the effects of a wide range of community\u00e2\u0080\u0090level interventions to address access to food in low\u00e2\u0080\u0090 and middle\u00e2\u0080\u0090income countries (LMICs). The body of evidence indicates that unconditional cash transfers (UCTs) can improve food security, income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation interventions do not seem to make a difference for food security, but the evidence is unclear for the other interventions. Conditional cash transfers (CCTs), UCTs, those that help generate income, and those that help minimise impact of food prices through food vouchers and subsidies can potentially improve dietary diversity. UCTs and food vouchers may have a potential impact on reducing stunting, but CCTs, income\u00e2\u0080\u0090generation interventions or social environment interventions do not seem to make a difference on wasting or stunting. CCTs seem to positively impact cognitive function and development but not UCTs. This may be due to the fact that in CCTs, beneficiaries are required to meet specific conditionalities such as attending school, visiting the health clinic regularly for growth monitoring or supplementation. None of the included studies reported on the primary outcome prevalence of undernourishment; in retrospect this was expected given that this is mostly used as a national\u00e2\u0080\u0090level indicator of food security. We found no studies reporting specific adverse outcomes. Three studies, one assessing UCTs and two assessing CCTs, reported on increased risk of overweight and obesity, our predefined adverse outcome. The effects on this outcome are unclear and we should thus not discard overweight and obesity as potential harms of these interventions. This is particularly problematic because in LMIC populations, where these interventions are implemented, overweight and obesity are often already a problem. Hawkes 2020 reported that this was the case in cash or food transfers and voucher interventions in Mexico, Egypt and the US where the unintended negative outcomes of these programmes include poorer diet quality and obesity and diabetes\u00e2\u0080\u0090related NCDs, due to increased intake of foods high in energy, sugar, fat and salt, resulting from the programme itself, or from the income from the programme that enabled people to purchase these types of foods. In some cases, the targeted populations experienced both undernutrition and overnutrition, such as the existence of undernourished children and obese mothers in the same household or community. Thus it is possible that these programmes may exacerbate existing problems. Potential solutions to prevent this could be related to specifying which types of foods can be purchased with interventions such as vouchers, and accompanying health education with transfers. As these interventions are often implemented at national level, direct implications for practitioners and the community are less clear. Organisations involved in the development and implementation of interventions to improve access to food may be able to better focus their time and resources by optimally designing or choosing programmes which maximise the intended outcome. Implications for research Here, we draw on the EPICOT framework \u00e2\u0080\u0093 which stands for Evidence, Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcomes, and Time stamp (Brown 2006) \u00e2\u0080\u0093 to suggest gaps in the evidence base that future research could address. There is enough evidence from RCTs for CCTs and UCTs but not for the other intervention types assessed in this review (i.e. those addressing food prices (e.g. policies, discounts, vouchers and subsidies); addressing infrastructure and transport that affect physical access to food outlets; and those addressing the social environment and providing social support (e.g. social support from family, neighbours or government)). In general, higher\u00e2\u0080\u0090quality RCTs and prospective controlled studies are required, particularly concerning methods to minimise the issues with selection and attrition bias. The multiplicity of outcome measures made analysis for this review challenging. It is thus important for future studies to have a similar set of outcomes that we can usefully compare across studies, and that are most relevant for assessing food and nutrition security at the community or household level. If primary studies measured similar outcomes, it would have likely been possible to pool the majority of results across included studies for this review, resulting in clearer review findings. None of the included studies clearly and specifically reported on adverse events. Although these types of interventions do not tend to have the same extent of harms as a clinical intervention, for example, it is still important to consider what the potential harms may be. Although overweight or obesity is a potential harm, the studies did not report on this as such. Most studies reported results from one to two years of the intervention. Longer\u00e2\u0080\u0090term studies of interventions aimed to improve food access in vulnerable communities or households are required.

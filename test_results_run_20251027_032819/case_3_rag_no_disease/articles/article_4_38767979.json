Abstract: Context Abstract: Abstract INTRO: INTRODUCTION INTRO: With 6 years remaining to end hunger, food insecurity and all forms of malnutrition (United Nations\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Sustainable Development Goal 2), global progress has regressed. Importantly, the greatest burden of malnutrition is shouldered by children and adolescents from the poorest and most marginalized communities, due to suboptimal food environments and diets. Like other high-income countries, food environments in Canada do not support the consumption of accessible, affordable, sustainable, nutritious, and healthy food. In fact, the majority of Canadian children and adolescents do not meet national dietary guidelines, and diet quality is poor. In addition, at least 1.4 million Canadian children experience food insecurity, and childhood obesity rates have doubled over the past 40\u00e2\u0080\u0089years. INTRO: With the recognition that early-life nutrition has life-long health and social implications, there have been global efforts to redesign, promote, and integrate multisectoral interventions across the life course and the continuum of care. The integration of nutrition within health, education, and social protection delivery platforms has been recognized as a critical opportunity to realize child and adolescent human rights to food and nutrition security. Schools are considered innovative platforms for life course interventions, especially for optimizing nutrition. Launched in the 1980s, the \u00e2\u0080\u009cHealth Promoting School\u00e2\u0080\u009d (HPS) approach (or \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhole-school approach\u00e2\u0080\u009d) was developed by the World Health Organization. The approach focuses on a broad spectrum of policies, program activities, and services that contribute to the health, safety, and well-being of students, staff, and families, while assuring a supportive and enabling environment that nurtures academic growth and development. INTRO: The concept of health promotion in schools has been adopted at different scales with varying approaches, such as the Comprehensive School Health Program in Canada, which comprises 8 components that relate to the following broader political, physical, and social contexts: health education, school-based health services, the school environment, physical education, food services, student counselling, staff health promotion, and community integration. A key aspect is improving the school food environment, which refers to the spaces and conditions inside and around school premises where food and beverages are available, obtained, purchased, and/or consumed, with consideration of nutritional content, promotion, pricing, and food safety. INTRO: Although there are limited data on what interventions, policies, and programs can effectively improve school food environments and, ultimately, the nutrition of children and adolescents in Canada, evidence from recent systematic reviews suggests that school-based nutrition interventions can have a positive effect on dietary outcomes, including fruit and vegetables intake. However, these effects are not necessarily actualized in changes to anthropometric outcomes, like body mass index (BMI). As such, our aim in conducting this systematic review was to synthesize and appraise literature on the Canadian school food environment and nutrition interventions, policies, and programs, and their effects on diets and nutritional status, while identifying research gaps, particularly for equity-seeking populations, and opportunities to empower decision-makers to plan for future action. METHODS: METHODS METHODS: Our search was conducted on December 20, 2021, for publications from the year 1990 to the present without language restrictions or search filters (ie, by population or outcome) within the following databases: MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, ERIC, Cochrane Collaboration, the Canadian Electronic Library (ie, Canadian Public Policy Collection, and the Canadian Electronic Library), Canadian Health Research Collection, and BiblioMap (the EPPI-Centre database of health promotion research) (see Table\u00e2\u0080\u0089S1 in the Supporting Information online). Search strategies were developed for each database along with free text and controlled vocabulary (ie, Medical Subject Heading terms). Additional search terms were included in consultation with an information specialist. Key search terms included the following: school health services, school nutrition, health promotion, and school policies. Our protocol was registered with PROSPERO (no. CRD42022303255). METHODS: A search for unpublished data and grey literature that met eligibility criteria was conducted. Some of the electronic databases we searched include a combination of published and unpublished studies. To ensure maximum coverage of unpublished literature and reduce the potential for publication bias, organizational websites and databases were searched using a keyword search in the area of food security and nutrition (see Table\u00e2\u0080\u0089S2 in the Supporting Information online). Where possible, we consulted technical experts regarding unpublished data discussed in webinars, newsletters, and other media sources. Reference lists of relevant systematic reviews, commentaries, and editorials were hand searched to find other eligible studies. METHODS: We included quantitative and qualitative studies conducted in Canada that had an observational study design (ie, cross-sectional, cohort, case-control, and ecological studies), interventional study design (ie, randomized controlled trials [RCTs], quasi-experimental studies [QES], intermittent time series, and controlled before-after studies), reviews (ie, systematic, literature, and scoping), or program evaluations. We included participants aged 5\u00e2\u0080\u009319.9\u00e2\u0080\u0089years (preschool, primary, middle, or high school). Studies that included participants outside of this age range and did not report disaggregated data were excluded (Table\u00e2\u0080\u00891). TABLE: SPIDER criteria for inclusion of studies TABLE: Criteria\tInclusion\t \tSample\tSchool-aged children and adolescents (preschool, primary, middle, or high school) in Canada\t \tPhenomenon of interest\tWhat evidence exists on the implementation of school food environment and nutrition interventions, programs, and policies?\t \tDesign\tObservational; randomized controlled trials; nonrandomized controlled trials (quasi-experimental, intermittent time series, controlled before-after); program evaluations; policy documents; reviews (literature/narrative, systematic)\t \tEvaluation\tStudies that primarily examine dimensions related to the RE-AIM framework for interventions, nonevaluated programs, and policies within the political, physical, economic, and sociocultural environments: reach, effectiveness (including direct measures of consumption, direct measures of diet quality, diet-related biomarkers, anthropometry, physical activity, education), adoption, implementation, and maintenance\t \tResearch type\tMixed methods (quantitative, qualitative data) METHODS: We evaluated included studies based on the RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance) framework that were focused on intervention, nonevaluated programs, or policy implementation. Importantly, adoption relates to the absolute number, proportion, and representativeness of interventions, nonevaluated programs, and policies adopted within provinces or territories. Reach relates to the absolute number, proportion, and representativeness of schools or individuals who participate in a given intervention or nonevaluated program or are affected by a policy. Implementation refers to the fidelity to various elements of an intervention, nonevaluated program, or policy, including consistency of delivery as intended. Importantly, it also includes adaptations made to interventions and implementation strategies. For the purposes of this study, key elements were changes to the school food environment, including food accessibility, food availability, and food promotion, as well as implementation barriers and facilitators. Maintenance refers to the long-term effects (\u00e2\u0089\u00a56\u00e2\u0080\u0089months) of an intervention, policy, or nonevaluated program on outcomes after it is completed either at the setting (institutionalization) or individual (retention of effectiveness) level. Effectiveness relates to the impact of an intervention, nonevaluated program, or policy on important individual outcomes, including potential negative effects, and variability across subgroups (generalizability or heterogeneity of effects). METHODS: In this review, we considered the following outcomes, which were author defined, under effectiveness on individuals: direct measures of consumption (ie, frequency of consumption, energy intake, macronutrient and micronutrient intake, food group intake, food consumption score, portion size); direct measures of diet quality (ie, food security, diet diversity score, meal score, Healthy Eating Index, other diet quality indices, diet adequacy); diet-related biomarkers (ie, micronutrient deficiencies); anthropometry (ie, nutritional status); physical activity; and education (ie, changes to knowledge, attitudes, and practices [KAP]). METHODS: We considered any interventions, nonevaluated programs, policies, regulations, and guidelines that affected the political, social, and physical school food and nutrition environment, including interventions for food availability, accessibility, policy, pricing, and promotion. For example, we included studies related to the provision of foods, including meals (breakfast, lunch, or dinner) or snacks consumed at school (hereafter, in-school feeding), and foods distributed to the family and consumed outside of the school setting (hereafter, take-home ration). We also included studies examining the economic (ie, price of healthy and unhealthy food items recorded, children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s spending restriction) and sociocultural (ie, behavioral interventions such as food and nutrition education) school environments. There was no minimum duration of follow-up for inclusion. METHODS: Studies conducted in schools were eligible for inclusion. Studies and reports that used data from multiple countries, including Canada, were required to report disaggregated data by country to be included in this review. Our primary outcomes were used as eligibility criteria for including studies (ie, if a study did not report any of the primary outcomes, it was excluded). However, we did not exclude studies on the basis of how that outcome was reported (ie, that an effect size is not estimable although the outcome was clearly measured). We excluded animal studies, conference abstracts, and letters or comments. METHODS: Data collection METHODS: We assessed study eligibility starting with title and abstract screening of all unique records identified by our search strategy. Once duplicates were removed, all records were uploaded into Covidence (Melbourne, VIC, Australia). Title and abstract screening was conducted by 3 independent reviewers (B.C., E.K., G.D.). Records were assessed according to the following exclusion criteria: incorrect topic area, ineligible document type, and duplicate document. METHODS: Full article text was found for all eligible studies and uploaded into Covidence. These were screened by 2 reviewers (G.D., E.K.) using the following exclusion criteria: incorrect topic area, incorrect population, ineligible document type, duplicate document, or no primary outcomes. Disagreements between the 2 reviewers were resolved by a third independent reviewer (B.C.). METHODS: Data from all eligible texts that proceeded to full-text extraction were extracted by 2 reviewers according to the following domains: general information, study setting and population, primary outcomes, and secondary outcomes. Because we expected variability in reported age bands, we made a post hoc decision in analysis of results at different age bands. Extracted data were matched by 2 independent reviewers (E.K., G.D., C.O., or R.J.), with any conflicts resolved by a third reviewer (B.C.). We attempted to contact authors of the original reports to obtain further details if required. METHODS: Risk of bias METHODS: Given the various study designs, we assessed the risk of bias (RoB) through different tools: for observational studies, the National Institutes of Health Quality Assessment Tool for Cohort and Cross-sectional Studies was used; for intervention studies, the Cochrane\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Risk of Bias Tool; for nonrandomized controlled trials, we used Risk of Bias in Nonrandomized Studies of Interventions tool; and for systematic reviews, A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews was used. Studies were scored by 2 independent review authors (E.K., G.D.). Each study was assigned an overall quality score, classified as low, low-moderate, moderate, moderate-serious, and serious. Scores from the 2 independent reviewers (E.K., G.D.) were compared and a final score was determined. In case of disagreements, a third review author (B.C.) was consulted. METHODS: Data synthesis METHODS: We forecasted that a meta-analysis would not be possible because of the scope of the study research questions and the range of outcome measures and methods. We narratively synthesized the findings that emerged. Results were summarized first on the basis of geography (ie, by province or territory) and then by study design (ie, RCT, QES, or observational), RoB assessment and impact on primary and secondary outcomes. For each extracted outcome, we analyzed the association on the basis of its effect estimate (odds ratio [OR] or risk ratio [RR]), confidence interval (CI), and whether the finding was statistically significant (P\u00e2\u0080\u0089\u00e2\u0089\u00a4\u00e2\u0080\u00890.05). Additionally, results were contextualized on the basis of social stratification (ie, by age, sex, socioeconomic status, geography, and ethnicity), using the Nutrition Equity Framework as guidance, as well as the broader political, physical, and social contexts that are key elements in the World Health Organization HPS. RESULTS: RESULTS RESULTS: Summary of results RESULTS: The search strategy retrieved 24\u00e2\u0080\u008a163 records comprising 23\u00e2\u0080\u008a825 peer-reviewed articles and 320 grey literature documents, and 14 articles that were identified through reference searching. Among the articles retrieved from databases, 17\u00e2\u0080\u008a949 articles underwent title and abstract screening. Thirteen articles published in French were screened and translated by a bilingual research assistant, and 6 of these were included in the screening. Of the 451 articles that underwent full-text review, 267 were excluded for the following reasons: wrong outcomes (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u0089126), wrong study design (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u008969), wrong setting (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u008940), wrong population (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u008924), wrong intervention (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00896), wrong time frame (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00891), or could not be retrieved (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00896). A total of 192 peer-reviewed studies were included in this review (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u0089178 from database and 14 from reference-list searching). Of the 320 grey literature articles that were screened, 187 underwent full-text review, and 106 were included. Overall, a total of 298 articles were included (Figure 1). For the purposes of this review, interventions were defined as any formal programs or initiatives that were observationally or experimentally evaluated by a peer-reviewed study. In comparison, nonevaluated programs refer to any program document either peer-reviewed or captured through grey literature that were not evaluated observationally or experimentally. FIG: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flow diagram RESULTS: Most of the literature was specific to Ontario (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u008952), British Columbia (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u008943), and Nova Scotia (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u008928); the fewest records were specific to the 3 territories, namely the Northwest Territories (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00893), Nunavut (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00892), and the Yukon (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00892). Approximately 10 systematic and 27 narrative reviews were also included, of which only 21 were specific to Canada, and the remaining 16 discussed food policies and programs internationally and included Canada. RESULTS: All included studies indicated the adoption of an intervention (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u008963, reported in 117 articles), a nonevaluated program (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u008942, reported in 48 articles), policy (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u008948, reported in 74 articles), and/or observed an unspecified program or policy (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u008922) related to school food and nutrition across Canada. In total, 192 articles specified reach, whether at the population, school, or community level. Implementation outcomes were identified in 134 articles; the outcomes were dominated by measures pertaining to implementation experiences, the school environment, and other cost-related factors. There were 86 articles in which effectiveness was measured for the following outcomes: anthropometry (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u008925), dietary intake (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u008956), KAP (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u008953), and changes in physical activity (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u008923). RESULTS: Given the heterogeneity of the programs, populations, and outcomes, meta-analyses could not be conducted to assess the effect on diets and nutritional status. However, among the 60 unique articles that evaluated dietary intake and/or anthropometric outcomes, 21 found a statistically significant positive change, 16 found no effect, 12 found mixed effects depending on outcome, and in 11, significance was unclear (see Figure\u00e2\u0080\u0089S1 in the Supporting Information online). In addition, 166 articles clearly indicated maintenance and sustainability of the intervention, nonevaluated program, and/or policy. Although these studies clearly note maintenance beyond 6\u00e2\u0080\u0089months at the time of publication, there are limited data available to confirm whether these initiatives have continued to the present day.

RESULTS: A total of 17 interventions (reported in 31 articles), 4 nonevaluated programs (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00897 articles), 2 reviews (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00892 articles), and 1 policy (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00893 articles) were specifically conducted with Indigenous populations or communities in Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, and the 3 Territories. In addition, 7 interventions (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u008917 articles) and 1 nonevaluated program (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00893 articles) explicitly mentioned the inclusion of Indigenous participants, among other ethnic populations, in Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, and Ontario. Four interventions (reported in 12 articles) were specifically implemented in low socioeconomic status (SES) areas in Alberta, Ontario, and Quebec, and 1 observational study (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00895 articles) also investigated school food environments in similar economically-disadvantaged communities in the Atlantic provinces. RESULTS: Summary of results: multi-regional RESULTS: Of the 298 articles included in this review, 62 articles reported data from multiple regions in Canada, of which 58 were peer-reviewed studies and 4 were from the grey literature (see Table\u00e2\u0080\u0089S4 in the Supporting Information online). Most of the peer-reviewed studies were reviews (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u008937) that were either systematic (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u008910) or narrative (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u008927). Of these, 14 reviews focused on compiling information on interventions, 22 reviews compiled information on policies, and 1 review investigated both programs and policies. The quality of the systematic reviews ranged from having critically low (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00896) to low (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00892) and moderate (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00892) RoB. Only 1 peer-reviewed study disaggregated data, using age and geographical location as equity indicators. RESULTS: Four unique interventions (reported in 8 articles), 5 policy documents (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00895 articles), 8 observational studies (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00898 articles), and 2 nonevaluated programs (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00894 articles) were included. The interventions were either single-component (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00892) or multicomponent (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00892) initiatives and programs, and were evaluated using QES (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00892) or observational (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00896) designs. Some single-component initiatives were the Kids Shop Smart Tour (nutrition education component only) in Alberta and British Columbia, and breakfast and lunch programs implemented in Newfoundland, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia that provided food to children between 5 and 12\u00e2\u0080\u0089years old located in poor, disadvantaged neighborhoods. Some multicomponent programs were part of the FitSpirit programs in Quebec and Ontario (nutrition education and physical activity component specifically for adolescent girls), and the Indigenous Youth Mentorship Program was developed to promote health through snack provisions and peer support for 13 Indigenous communities across the country. RESULTS: Two observational studies surveyed school food environments across all provinces and territories by identifying the presence of food programs and healthy food initiatives, which included hosting cooking classes, implementing media literacy education, and creating access to a school cafeteria, retail stores, and/or vending machines. Two studies used cross-sectional data from the Cannabis, Obesity, Mental Health, Physical Activity, Alcohol, Smoking, Sedentary Behaviour (COMPASS) study to evaluate policy compliance. One study reported a lack of adherence of nutritional policies with respect to vending machines within schools. The other study used cross sectional student and school-level data that explored adolescent dietary behaviors in relation to open- and closed-campus policies. Students who attended closed-campus-policy schools reported eating lunch purchased from fast food outlets and restaurants and drinking sugar-sweetened beverages on fewer weekdays, though consumed snacks from school vending machines on more weekdays compared with students at open-campus schools. One study explored the influence of mandatory versus voluntary provincial school nutrition policies (SNPs) on student eating behaviors as part of the 2015 Cancer Risk Assessment in Youth Survey. The study found that, overall, neither \u00e2\u0080\u009chealthful\u00e2\u0080\u009d nor \u00e2\u0080\u009cnon-healthful\u00e2\u0080\u009d eating behaviors differed significantly between schools with voluntary and mandatory nutrition policies. RESULTS: All 4 grey literature documents discussed breakfast programs provided to elementary and high school students in multiple regions across the country, such as those run by the Breakfast Club of Canada. In 2018\u00e2\u0080\u00932019, the Breakfast Club of Canada involved 1809 schools across the country, including 269 schools among Indigenous communities. The School Breakfast Program, through the Grocery Foundation, helps various student nutrition programs (NPs) across the country purchase healthy food for reduced costs by partnering with industry stakeholders, companies, and others. RESULTS: Summary of results: Alberta RESULTS: A total of 24 articles were included that reported data from Alberta. These included 21 peer-reviewed studies and 3 grey literature documents (see Table\u00e2\u0080\u0089S5 in the Supporting Information online). Of these, 10 were unique interventions (reported in 16 articles), 3 nonevaluated programs (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00892 articles), 3 policies (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00895 articles), and 1 observational study (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00891 article). No reviews specifically investigating programs and policies in Alberta were identified. RESULTS: The 10 unique interventions were conducted as QES (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00896) or program evaluations (observational studies) (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00895), with additional program documents and secondary or modelling analyses (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00895). Three of the included QES were assessed as having serious RoB (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00893) and 3 had moderate RoB (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00893),; the observational studies were assessed as having low (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00893), low-moderate (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00891), and moderate (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00891) RoB. Fifteen studies measured and reported on implementation, and 11 studies assessed effectiveness, including anthropometric measures (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00894), dietary intake (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00896), physical activity (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00895), and KAP of students (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00898). RESULTS: One intervention program reported in several articles is the Alberta Project Promoting Active Living and Healthy Eating (APPLE) Schools program, which was originally implemented in schools in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods, including those in Indigenous communities. APPLE Schools has since expanded to British Columbia, Manitoba, and the Northwest Territories, where estimates indicate that almost 30\u00e2\u0080\u008a000 students from 87 elementary and junior high schools benefit from the program within a given year. It is multicomponent by design, with particular focus placed on nutrition education to improve healthy eating habits, physical activity, and mental well-being. Evidence from 2012 reported an average of 0.55 more servings of fruits and vegetables (95%CI, \u00e2\u0080\u00930.02, 1.13; not significant) and 212.11 fewer calories per day (95%CI, \u00e2\u0080\u0093315.07, \u00e2\u0080\u0093109.16; P\u00e2\u0080\u0089<\u00e2\u0080\u00890.05) among students in APPLE schools compared with those attending other schools. However, in the long term, no differences in knowledge, attitudes, self-efficacy, diet, physical activity, and weight status were observed among APPLE School graduates compared with non-APPLE School graduates, which suggests an overall equalizing effect for these disadvantaged populations. RESULTS: The remaining interventions were located in Calgary (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00893), Camrose and its surrounding counties (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00891), the Alexander First Nation community (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00892), and other school partners across the province. All were conducted in elementary and junior high schools. Nutrition education and gardening were key components in several interventions to improve health literacy and behaviors. Some interventions were multicomponent and included physical activity (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00891) or food provisions (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00893), such as milk and snacks. However, only the snack programs were provided at no cost. Despite students having to pay for milk provisions, the calcium (1423 vs 1344\u00e2\u0080\u0089mg) and vitamin\u00e2\u0080\u0089D (10.8 vs 9.7\u00e2\u0080\u0089\u00c2\u00b5g) intake among grade 6\u00e2\u0080\u009312 students participating in the Alberta School Milk Program significantly increased compared to those who did not partake in the program. This program is 1 of only 2 studies in which data were disaggregated on the basis of equity indicators, specifically age, geographical location, and SES. RESULTS: Only 1 observational study unrelated to a policy or program was identified in Alberta. That study specifically investigated the Alexander First Nation school food environment by assessing the health quality of foods available to students. The researchers found that although schools provide breakfast, lunch, and concession foods, healthy options remain limited. RESULTS: Three food and nutrition policies in Alberta schools were identified. One study investigating a policy in an Alexander First Nation school found several barriers that prevented adequate policy adherence, such as inconsistent implementation, staff uncertainty about the lack of school communication with parents, and perceived misalignment between nutrition recommendations and traditional Indigenous foods in the community. An evaluation of an SNP used a mixed-methods design that included a semi-structured interview to capture First Nations parents' perceptions and to identify facilitators and barriers to policy implementation. Nearly all parents (95%) responded in support of the policy, and 93% believed it was important for their children to have healthy food choices at school. This study reported a few barriers to policy implementation, including lack of support for guidelines concerning celebrations and fundraisers, inadequate communication, and cost availability and accessibility of healthy food. As well, although parents were aware and in support of the policy, none demonstrated a comprehensive understanding of the policy content. Parents also reported the high cost and low availability and accessibility of healthy foods in the community hindered their ability to provide healthy foods for their children at home. RESULTS: Summary of results: British Columbia RESULTS: A total of 43 articles were included data from British Columbia. These included 26 peer-reviewed studies and 17 grey literature documents (see Table\u00e2\u0080\u0089S6 in the Supporting Information online). The articles represent 10 unique interventions (reported in 21 articles), 5 policies (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u008910 articles), 5 observational studies unrelated to any policies or programs (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00895 articles), and 7 nonevaluated programs (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00897 articles). No reviews related to food and nutrition policies or programs specific to British Columbia were found. RESULTS: Two interventions were conducted on Vancouver Island; the remaining 8 varied by location across the province. These interventions were evaluated using the following designs: RCTs (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00893), QES (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00895), secondary analyses (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00891), and observational studies (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u008912). The RCTs were assessed as either having serious (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00892) or moderate (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00891) RoB, whereas most of the QES had serious (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00894), or moderate (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00891) RoB. RESULTS: The Action Schools! BC (AS! BC) program involved 39 school districts in unspecified metropolitan centers; its AS! BC First Nations adaptation was implemented in 3 schools in the rural and Indigenous communities of the Tsimshian Nation. Similarly, the Healthy Buddies program was implemented in 45 schools across the Sunshine Coast region, and its Healthy Buddies First Nations adaptation was also implemented in 2 schools in the Tsimshian Nation communities. The Learning for Life Program was implemented in 3 schools: 1 with an inner-city immigrant population, 1 with a rural and Indigenous population, and 1 was a predominantly European regional center. The remaining Health Promoting Secondary Schools program was conducted in 5 schools on the lower mainland and Vancouver Island. Among these, the intervention and Learning for Life program were single-component studies (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00892) with a particular focus on providing nutrition education alone to improve literacy and promote healthy lifestyle behaviors. The remaining interventions were multicomponent (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00896), combining a nutrition component, often through food provisions and in-class lessons, with a physical activity component. Altogether, these interventions were free and supported more than 1600 students, ranging from kindergarten to grade 12. RESULTS: The majority of studies assessed KAP outcomes (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u008910), such as changes in health literacy from the Learning for Life program, identifying a significant increase (P\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00890.009) immediately after implementation, but reported that scores significantly decreased (P\u00e2\u0080\u0089<\u00e2\u0080\u00890.001) after 2 months despite the majority of participants reporting consistent efforts to maintain healthy lifestyle changes. Anthropometric (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00897) and dietary intake (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00899) outcomes were also measured, although results varied. For instance, the AS! BC program found significant increases (P\u00e2\u0080\u0089<\u00e2\u0080\u00890.05) in fruit and vegetable consumption after 12\u00e2\u0080\u0089weeks, which differed from the outcomes of the AS! BC First Nations adaption, which found no significant impact on daily consumption of fruits and vegetables, or sugar and sweetened beverages (SSBs) by their Indigenous population. Surveys of Vancouver schools identified that most schools in the region had healthy food available and implemented relatively new food-related learning activities; however, student participation remained low. Equity indicators were also used to disaggregate data by age (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00894) and sex (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00892). RESULTS: The majority of the grey literature reporting data from British Columbia provided comprehensive summaries and/or guidelines for the respective policies and programs; a few publications reported evaluations of interventions. A major provincial program is the Healthy Schools BC government initiative, which helps support health education and provides partnerships between various government ministries, health authorities, schools, and community partners with the primary aim to create healthier school environments. Many subprograms, such as the Fruit and Vegetable Nutritional program and Farm to School program, are funded through Healthy Schools BC. One evaluation was completed in 503 schools across the province among school-aged children and adolescents (kindergarten to grade 12). Only 3.8% of the schools had a policy emphasizing the types of food and beverage products sold within schools. Of the schools that regularly provided meals or snacks, 62.8% provided breakfast and 63.7% provided snacks. Another provincial evaluation conducted in 2019 revealed that only half of students regularly ate breakfast on school days. Compared with the results of the 2013 survey, there was a slight decrease in the percentage of students who consumed fruits and vegetables at least once on the day prior to completing survey. RESULTS: To examine school-level changes associated with implementation of the Food and Beverage Sales in Schools and daily physical activity guidelines in British Columbia, elementary, middle school, and high school principals were asked to complete a survey on the school food and physical activity environment in 2007\u00e2\u0080\u00932008 (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u0089513) and 2011\u00e2\u0080\u00932012 (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u0089490). In 2011\u00e2\u0080\u00932012, 66% reported full implementation of guidelines for vending machines, followed by 45%, 36%, 10%, and 8% for snack bars, cafeterias, fundraising activities, and special events, respectively. A realist evaluation was conducted using semi-structured interviews (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u008923), structured questionnaires (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u008962), participant observations at public events (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00893), and scans of school, school district, and health authority (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u008967) websites across 5 public school districts. Four mechanisms influencing the implementation of British Columbia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s school food and beverage sales policy were identified: (1) mandatory mechanism, (2) scofflaw mechanism, (3) economic mechanism, and (4) resource constraint mechanism. RESULTS: Summary of results: Manitoba RESULTS: Twenty-one articles specific to Manitoba were identified, comprising 6 peer-reviewed studies and 15 grey literature documents (see Table\u00e2\u0080\u0089S7 in the Supporting Information online). These included 4 unique interventions (reported in 6 articles); 4 policies, guidelines, and recommendations (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u008911 articles); and 4 nonevaluated programs (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00894 articles). The 6 peer-reviewed studies represented approximately 773 students in grades 1\u00e2\u0080\u009312; 1 study did not report the number students included. A total of 520 schools were included; however, 1 study accounted for 498 of these schools. Four studies were conducted in elementary schools, 1 in a middle school, and 1 included schools with grades 7 or higher. Of the 15 documents from the grey literature search, 7 pertained to the government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s provincial \u00e2\u0080\u009cMoving Forward with School Nutrition\u00e2\u0080\u009d policies and guidelines. These documents outline guidelines on how to establish, facilitate, and evaluate various programs to promote a healthier school food environment. RESULTS: Four interventions and 1 nonevaluated program were multicomponent, integrating nutrition programming with physical activity (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00893), anatomy (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00891), and antismoking (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00891) initiatives. Six studies addressed food behaviors, 2 modified the food environment, and 1 implemented a combination of the 2. Youth mentors were engaged for 2 interventions to facilitate the education of younger students. Five were free to students; 2 did not specify if there was a charge. Four interventions and nonevaluated programs were conducted in mixed urban and rural settings, 3 were conducted in exclusively urban settings, and 1 in rural settings. The Healthy Buddies intervention and 1 nonevaluated program were created specifically with Indigenous children in mind; in 1 additional study, approximately 28.3% (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u0089183 of 647) of the included participants identified as First Nations members, although the program was not intentionally created for this population. Two interventions disaggregated data by an equity indicator, specifically, age (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00892), sex (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00892), and rural or urban geographic location (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00892). Of the 4 evaluated interventions, 1 used an observational study design. Specifically, this study analyzed cross-sectional data to observe changes in enrollment in Home Economics Food and Nutrition courses for grades 7\u00e2\u0080\u009312 from 2000 to 2010 and found that enrollment increased over the course of the study (from 25.67% to 29.75%), with the largest increases reported in northern and remote areas; however, enrollment in these areas was still slightly lower compared with Winnipeg by 2010. Despite these findings, interviews with school staff (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u008913) revealed that the sustainability of Home Economics Food and Nutrition courses faces notable challenges due to being undervalued in school settings in favor of other courses, and due to dissonance between Home Economics Food and Nutrition teachings and changing social norms toward a culture of fast food and fewer family meals. RESULTS: Three interventions were evaluated with an experimental study. Two were RCTs of moderate and serious quality, and 1 was a QES of moderate quality. Interventions ranged from 2\u00e2\u0080\u0089weeks to 22\u00e2\u0080\u0089months and included approximately 736 students, aged 6 to 13\u00e2\u0080\u0089years, from 21 schools. All interventions were assessed quantitatively ; 1 used qualitative data as well. One intervention reported on anthropometry and dietary changes, and the remaining 3 interventions reported KAP, including health knowledge scores (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00891), positive development (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00891), and attendance (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00891). RESULTS: Healthy Buddies is a school-based nutrition, physical activity, and body image health promotion program that was introduced by Manitoba\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Healthy Schools Initiative in 2009 after adapting the pilot program that originated in British Columbia. Throughout the 2009\u00e2\u0080\u00932010 school year, teachers provided weekly healthy-living lessons to older students (aged 9\u00e2\u0080\u009312\u00e2\u0080\u0089years), who then acted as peer mentors to teach 30-min weekly lessons to their younger \u00e2\u0080\u009cbuddies\u00e2\u0080\u009d (6\u00e2\u0080\u00938\u00e2\u0080\u0089years). Students pairs also received 2 30-minute aerobic fitness sessions per week. A total of 19 elementary schools (incorporating 10 interventions and 9 control) and 647 students were included in the trial. Intention-to-treat analyses indicated that waist circumference significantly decreased in the intervention group relative to the control group (between group difference, \u00e2\u0080\u00931.60\u00e2\u0080\u0089cm; 95%CI, \u00e2\u0080\u00932.28, \u00e2\u0080\u00930.91; P\u00e2\u0080\u0089<\u00e2\u0080\u00890.001), particularly for children who were overweight or obese or attending First Nations schools. Multivariable analyses (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u0089311) further revealed significant reductions in boys, children from lower-income situations, and children living in rural areas (P\u00e2\u0080\u0089<\u00e2\u0080\u00890.05). Changes in BMI z-scores were not significantly different between groups (P\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00890.55) or within any subgroup. Self-reported food and drink intake, and nutrition knowledge significantly improved among younger students in the intervention group compared with the control group (P\u00e2\u0080\u0089<\u00e2\u0080\u00890.05) but not for older students. RESULTS: In comparison, the Lifestyles Board Game was an educational intervention aimed to increase children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s knowledge of anatomy, nutrition, and lifestyle risk factors for noncommunicable diseases among a class of grade 6 students (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u008923) in Winnipeg. After playing the board game twice, 2 weeks apart, overall knowledge scores significantly improved (P\u00e2\u0080\u0089<\u00e2\u0080\u00890.05) on a post-test in the intervention group compared with the control group. RESULTS: Moreover, the Heart Experts and Research Team intervention was a school-based youth development program that spanned 2 school years and involved 26 students, aged 12 to 13\u00e2\u0080\u0089years, from a middle school in an urban setting. Students received 6 in-class intervention sessions, including a healthy food workshop and a heart-healthy research workshop, that were designed to enhance students\u00e2\u0080\u0099 knowledge and team-building and leadership skills. Positive Youth Development scores did not significantly improve after the intervention compared with baseline; however, focus group findings revealed positive health behavior changes and increased self-efficacy related to cardiovascular health. Although the program was well received, staff and students were less motivated during the second year of the intervention and indicated preference for a shorter program with greater intensity. RESULTS: Summary of results: New Brunswick RESULTS: Eight articles specific to New Brunswick were found (see Table\u00e2\u0080\u0089S8 in the Supporting Information online). These included 5 policies, guidelines, and frameworks (reported in 5 articles) and 3 nonevaluated programs (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00893 articles). Seven of these documents were from the grey literature and did not formally evaluate the policies and programs discussed. RESULTS: Three nonevaluated programs were reported in documents retrieved through the grey literature search: the New Brunswick Healthy Learners in School Program, Mango Mania initiative, and the program run through Le R\u00c3\u00a9seau des caf\u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9rias communautaires Inc. and the Really Local Harvest cooperative. The Healthy Learners in School Program is a provincial program established in 2000 that coordinates health promotion and prevention activities in classrooms and schools. The Mango Mania initiative is a population-health, community-based program conducted in schools that promote healthy lifestyle habits, including healthy eating, physical activity, and screen-time restrictions. The program run by Le R\u00c3\u00a9seau des caf\u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9rias communautaires and the Really Local Harvest intended to promote healthy food procurement and eating habits. RESULTS: Five policies, guidelines, and frameworks were identified; however, only 1 was assessed in a scientific study, and this was the only peer-reviewed study specific to New Brunswick that was included in the review. Researchers conducted semi-structured interviews with 50 participants at the provincial, district, and school levels during 1997\u00e2\u0080\u00931999. The current perception of the Food and Nutrition Policy for New Brunswick Schools is that it is a \u00e2\u0080\u009cgoodwill\u00e2\u0080\u009d policy implemented at the discretion of individual schools. When the policy was first proclaimed, it led to much controversy that caused the department to retreat from full implementation. Opposition centered around 4 issues: (1) profit from food sales, (2) student choice, (3) policy interpretation, and (4) policy implementation. Priority of nutrition ranged from low to high among school responses. Examples of low priority of nutrition were the pressure to increase literacy and math levels, nutrition is not an issue for the public, disagreement with the nature of the policy, and other issues had a much higher priority. High priority reasons of nutrition included that a principal was on the district of the nutrition committee and wanted to be a trendsetter, a principal worked with the food-service provider after teachers and parents raised concerns, the district called for change, and the school decided to make significant changes. RESULTS: Summary of results: Newfoundland and Labrador RESULTS: Six articles specific to Newfoundland and Labrador were identified, comprising 3 peer-reviewed studies and 3 grey literature documents (see Table\u00e2\u0080\u0089S9 in the Supporting Information online). These represented 2 unique interventions (reported in 3 articles) and 2 policies and guidelines (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00893 articles). Of the 2 unique interventions, 1 was conducted in middle schools and 1 in elementary schools. These studies included approximately 146 students and 100 school personnel. Only 1 study reported the number of schools of included (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00893). RESULTS: All interventions and nonevaluated programs were offered free to students, and 1 was multicomponent and included elements of physical activity. One program operated in both urban and rural settings and 1 did not disclose its setting(s). Two interventions reported KAP outcomes; however, neither was able to assess dietary or anthropometric measures. One study used an observational study design to assess the implementation of Children Aiming to Choose Health, a resource toolkit designed to help educators promote healthy behaviors in a learning environment. At the time of the follow-up survey in winter of 2009, the majority (55%) of educational facilitators had yet to use the toolkit since its dissemination in the fall of 2008, indicating time constraints and limited access to toolkits between classrooms as the main barriers of use. Still, 44% of total respondents reported observing positive changes in children since the resource kit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s introduction; however, students were not assessed to support this finding. RESULTS: One intervention was experimentally evaluated and used a QES design that was assessed to have serious RoB. This study assessed the impact of a cardiovascular health education program, which included 7 45-minute in-school health education classes on cardiovascular health knowledge among 146 grade-8 students. Knowledge scores increased from baseline for both the urban and rural intervention groups; however, this improvement was only significant for the latter group (degrees of freedom\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u008942; Tukey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s test, \u00ce\u00b1\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00892.98). The program was well received among rural students: 86.4% (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u008919 of 22) found the program informative and 68.2% (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u008915 of 22) would recommend its inclusion into their regular health education classes. Student satisfaction was not assessed for in urban schools, and the study did not assess dietary or anthropometric outcomes. RESULTS: Two provincial guidelines were identified through the grey literature search: School Food Guidelines for School Food Providers and the Eating Healthier in Newfoundland and Labrador Provincial Food and Nutrition Framework and Action Plan. The first guideline document provided information to school providers with regard to what food and beverage products should be sold in schools and how to serve healthier meals and snacks. These guidelines were updated in 2008 to reflect the revised Canada\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Food Guide. The second guideline document provided a broader framework for the province to provide children and youth healthier food through school food programs. RESULTS: Summary of results: Nova Scotia RESULTS: Twenty-eight articles specific to Nova Scotia were identified, of which 14 were peer-reviewed and 14 were grey literature documents (see Table\u00e2\u0080\u0089S10 in the Supporting Information online). These included 2 unique interventions (reported in 10 articles), 1 of which was evaluated by 3 separate groups of researchers, 2 nonevaluated programs (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00892 articles), 10 policies and guidelines (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u008914 articles), and 2 observational studies unrelated to a specific policy or program (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00892 articles). Four studies used data from the Children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Lifestyle and School Performance Study, a cross-sectional provincial study that assessed nutrition, physical activity, mental health, and academic performance among grade-5 students in Nova Scotia who were exposed to a HPS program in 2003 and 2011. Approximately 13\u00e2\u0080\u008a874 participants in grades 4\u00e2\u0080\u00937 were included across 3 sources; 3 studies or sources did not collect data from students and conducted assessments at the school level. In total, 878 schools were included, the majority of which (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u0089693\u00e2\u0080\u0093737) were elementary schools. RESULTS: Of the 4 unique interventions and nonevaluated programs, all were multicomponent, combining strategies to modify food behaviors (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00894) and/or the food environment (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00893) with physical activity initiatives. All were free to students and the majority were conducted in mixed urban and rural (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00893), with 1 conducted in an urban community only. Two interventions were evaluated and the following outcomes were reported: dietary intake (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00895), physical activity (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00895), anthropometry (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00894), and KAP (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00892). No studies disaggregated data by an equity indicator. RESULTS: One of these programs implemented the HPS framework adapted from recommendations by the World Health Organization used to guide the implementation of multicomponent health promotion interventions in schools. Three derivatives of HPS interventions in Nova Scotia were discussed in 10 documents, including 9 peer-reviewed studies. Five articles assessed general HPS initiatives throughout Nova Scotia, 1 assessed HPS in the Tri-County Regional School Board area, and 3 assessed the Annapolis Valley Health Promoting Schools Project (AVHPSP) in Annapolis Valley. Six articles used an observational study design and 1 conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis. In 2011, 5\u00e2\u0080\u0089years after the province-wide introduction of HPS in Nova Scotia in 2006, of 269 elementary schools across the province, 71.8% provided health education in line with HPS practices, 66.4% had a healthy school environment, and 63.1% had a subsidized food program, of which 72.9% adhered to nutrition policies. Of the schools that sold food, 82.3% adhered to nutrition policies and 59.1% priced healthy foods competitively. RESULTS: Despite these findings, the prevalence of obesity and diet quality scores among grade-5 students were not significantly different compared with data from 2003, before the province\u00e2\u0080\u0099s introduction to HPS. In the rural Tri-County Regional School Board area, a qualitative study involving 18 elementary schools found that schools implementing a HPS approach had greater quantity and quality of visual promotions for healthy eating compared with non-HPS schools. In terms of accessibility, processed foods were more available in non-HPS schools; however, these schools also had more resources for food produce (ie, school gardens). This same study found that students in grades 4\u00e2\u0080\u00936 attending HPS schools had nonsignificantly higher Diet Quality Index\u00e2\u0080\u0093International z-scores, on average, than students from non-HPS schools (mean \u00c2\u00b1 SD, 0.04\u00e2\u0080\u0089\u00c2\u00b1\u00e2\u0080\u00890.99 vs mean \u00c2\u00b1 SD, \u00e2\u0080\u00930.07\u00e2\u0080\u0089\u00c2\u00b1\u00e2\u0080\u00891.02). HPS programs appeared to have a positive impact in Annapolis Valley as reported by a cross-sectional study involving 5200 grade-5 students from 282 schools. This study compared anthropometric and dietary outcomes between schools implementing the AVHPSP with schools using other NPs and no NPs, and found that all measured nutrition-related outcomes were in favor of the NP component of the AVHPSP. Additionally, rates of overweight (OR, 0.41; 95%CI, 0.32, 0.53) and obesity (OR, 0.28; 95%CI, 0.14, 0.57) were significantly lower among students from schools implementing the AVHPSP compared with schools without a NP, and nonsignificantly lower than among students from schools with a different NP. Schools implementing the AVHPSP also reported comparatively more fruit and vegetable consumption (AVHPS, 6.7 servings/day; other NP, 5.8 servings/day; no NP, 5.7 servings/day), better diet quality (Diet Quality International-I score: AVHPSP, 64.5; other NP, 62.1; no NP, 62.3), and less dietary fat intake as a proportion of total calories (AVHPSP, 29.4%; other NP, 30.3%; no NP, 30.3%). RESULTS: Only 1 intervention was experimentally evaluated and used a QES design that was assessed to have serious RoB. The Dartmouth Health Promotion Study assessed the Coordinated Approach, an intersectoral health promotion education strategy that spanned the community and schools. The included study assessed the school-based health curriculum component with 2 cohorts of students initially in grade 4, over 3\u00e2\u0080\u00934 years, and found no significant improvements in heart-health knowledge scores compared with control schools. RESULTS: A total of 14 documents reported on the implementation of school and nutrition policies, guidelines, recommendations, and curriculum directives, of which 4 studies formally evaluated policy implementation with a cross-sectional study design. A study by McIssac and colleagues (2019) assessed the current-state assessment of policy implementation and adherence. Adequacy and capacity for food policy implementation were used to assess policy adherence through the availability of prohibited \u00e2\u0080\u009cminimum\u00e2\u0080\u009d nutrition foods. Overall, 237 schools were included, spanning primary grades and kindergarten to high schools, with an average of 332 students and 33 staff per school. Schools reporting above-average facilities and perceived adequacy and capacity for policy implementation had greater odds of adhering to a lunch policy (OR, 3.62; 95%CI, 1.56, 8.40), whereas schools that adhered to a snack and lunch policy had lower odds of serving quick-service foods (OR, 0.48 [95%CI, 0.23, 1.01]; and OR, 0.18 [95%CI: 0.08, 0.41], respectively). RESULTS: The Grow Eat Learn program is a province-wide program that supports and grows school food gardens to encourage healthy eating and lifestyle habits among students, and for the school environments to be successful and sustainable. The provincial government in 2006 established an official Food and Nutrition Policy for Nova Scotia Public Schools, which includes standards for food and beverages provided in public schools and a provincial breakfast program. The provincial government also released guidelines for nutrition-focused curricula for grades 8 and 12, phasing out fast foods in schools and fundraising and replacing with healthy food and beverages. RESULTS: One observational study assessed the school food environment through a secondary analysis of a cross-sectional study. Interviews with 23 principals, teachers, and volunteers, from 9 elementary schools, involved in NPs revealed that NPs may not be addressing the root causes of food insecurity and, instead, may be contributing to health inequities. Qualitative findings specifically revealed that the latter may occur through the negative impact of NPs on the stigmatization and social exclusion of families with food insecurity. RESULTS: Summary of results: Ontario RESULTS: A total of 52 articles were included that reported information on Ontario, including 37 peer-reviewed and 15 grey literature documents (see Table\u00e2\u0080\u0089S11 in the Supporting Information online). We identified 21 unique interventions (reported on in 30 articles), 11 nonevaluated programs (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u008914 articles), 1 policy (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00896 articles), and 2 observational studies (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00892 articles) unrelated to a policy or program were identified. No reviews related specific to the Ontario school food and nutrition context were found. RESULTS: Interventions were formally conducted using RCTs (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00893) or QES (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u008910), or were program evaluations (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00898). Included RCTs were assessed as moderate (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00892) and serious (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00891) RoB. The QES primarily had moderate RoB (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00897) and the remaining 3 had serious RoB. Observational studies, including program evaluations, were assessed as having low-moderate risk (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00898) or low risk (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00898). Of 21 interventions, seven were conducted in rural Indigenous communities in Northern Ontario. The remaining interventions were conducted in urban city centers (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00895), semi-rural communities (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00891), various areas in Southern Ontario (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00895), and unspecified locations in the province (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00893). Altogether, these programs were provided free to students and represent approximately 2016 elementary schools, with the Fresh from the Farm program comprising the majority of 1700 participating schools across the province. RESULTS: Most interventions were also multicomponent (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u008913), with a mixture of either food provisions, nutritional education, physical activity, or other initiatives that engaged teachers, parents, and community members in their programming. The most common component included was food provisions (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00898) to students through breakfast, snack, and/or lunch. Similarly, food provisions were also the most common element among single-component programs (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00894). Nutrition education was identified in 2 studies, as well as an alternative program that changed the school-day schedule to include additional time for snack periods (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00891). RESULTS: The majority of interventions discussed KAP outcomes (reported on in 15 articles), followed by outcomes relating to dietary intake (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u008913), which resulted in significantly positive improvements in fruit and vegetable intake among students. For instance, use of the Everyone Jump program lessons on nutrition, conducted in St. Catherines, significantly improved student knowledge about Canada\u00e2\u0080\u0099s food guide (F(1,252)\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00895.58; P\u00e2\u0080\u0089<\u00e2\u0080\u00890.05); however, this did not significantly affect healthy food behaviors regarding vegetable intake relative to the control group (P\u00e2\u0080\u0089\u00e2\u0089\u00a5\u00e2\u0080\u00890.05). Long-term studies also found that although significant increases in fruit and vegetable consumption may have been found immediately after assessment, the impact was often short-lived considering 1-year follow-up assessments showed insignificant changes. The following equity indicators were used to disaggregate data: age (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00893), sex (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00895), and ethnicity (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00891). RESULTS: Although the 2 observational studies we identified were unrelated to a specific food policy or program, they both provided prevalence outcomes of school NPs. One study found that of 14 elementary schools boards across the province, 91.5% had breakfast programs and 93.3% had snack programs that provided nutritious foods in sufficient quantities. Alternatively, another survey of 22 school NPs in a large, urban region found that although all programs provided breakfast, lunch, and/or snacks for free, food quality and services differed between schools, given programs were voluntary and operated independently from one another. RESULTS: Of the 15 grey literature documents we found, almost all were policy or nonevaluated program documents with general summaries and guidelines, including Ontario\u00e2\u0080\u0099s School Food and Beverage Policy. Some of the provincial programs described include Nourishing Young Minds (a student NP; Ontario\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Student Nutrition Program), a province-wide program that helps schools provide nutritious meals and snacks; and various smaller programs that address healthy eating, nutrition education, and food accessibility, such as the Great Big Crunch, School Food Delivery Program, Ontario\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Student Nutrition Program, Vegetable and Fruit Delivery Program, and Tasty Ontario Tuesdays. Some local programs included classroom gardens, breakfast programs, and student NPs that were run in Ottawa and Toronto. One document reported a program evaluation for the Feeding Our Future program across 7 sites in Toronto, using both quantitative and qualitative methods. RESULTS: Ontario mandated the School Food and Beverage Policy No. 150 as a set of nutritional standards applied to foods and beverages offered for sale in school food venues, at school events, and through NPs. One study used the comprehensive school health framework (social and physical environments; teaching and learning; healthy school policy; and partnerships and services) to describe schools\u00e2\u0080\u0099 support for healthy eating during the implementation phase during 2 time points: 2012\u00e2\u0080\u00932013 and 2014. Twenty schools remained in the \u00e2\u0080\u009caction\u00e2\u0080\u009d category across both time points. The physical environment was well supported (100%), with safe, clean spaces for students to eat. The social environment pillar was the least supported (68%), and healthy eating was not often highly valued, with few schools identifying healthy eating to be a very high (16%) or high (8%) priority. A qualitative study using in-depth, semi-structured interviews aimed to identify local-level factors shaping the implementation of an SNP. Four key emerging themes were identified: (1) economic environment (ie, the cost of healthy food for sale; loss of revenue generation); (2) physical environment (ie, the proximity of schools to off-site food outlets; link between healthy eating and student learning); (3) political environment (ie, the restrictive nature of policy guidelines; role of key stakeholders); and (4) sociocultural environment (ie, the role of stigma; school culture). RESULTS: Summary of results: Prince Edward Island RESULTS: Nine articles specific to Prince Edward Island were included, of which there were 4 nonevaluated programs (Community Food Security and Food Education 2017 Projects, Yum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Food Adventures, Free Milk Day, and Milk Sport) reported in \u00e2\u0080\u00892 articles, 2 policies (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00893 articles), and 1 intervention (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00894 articles) (see Table\u00e2\u0080\u0089S12 in the Supporting Information online). Few primary outcomes were reported because only 2 articles were peer-reviewed. RESULTS: The Community Food Security and Food Education Program is a provincial program that was established by multiple departments of government, including the departments of Agriculture and Fisheries, Health and Wellness, and Education, Early Learning and Culture. The program involves several sub-programs that aim to improve food literacy among communities, community garden projects, and cooperatives to ensure healthy and local food is provided to school-aged children. The Prince Edward Island School Milk Foundation runs several programs that target kindergarten and elementary school students. Yum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Food Adventures is an in-class program that educates about healthy eating according to Canada\u00e2\u0080\u0099s food guide. Free Milk Day and Milk Sport are programs that encourage more dairy consumption as part of healthy eating and lifestyle habits. RESULTS: We identified 3 articles related to school nutrition policies, 2 of which were formal evaluations of the Prince Edward Island School Nutrition Policy using qualitative and QES designs. In 2006, a total of 52 elementary schools implemented the policy. This study compared food consumption using a self-administered validated food frequency questionnaire from 2007 (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u0089555) and a previous survey from 2001\u00e2\u0080\u00932002 (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u0089971). Results showed students in 2007 were twice as likely to report consuming fewer than 3 servings of low-nutrient density foods (OR, 2.14; 95%CI, 1.62, 2.82) and were also more likely to consume the recommended servings of vegetables and fruit than students in 2001\u00e2\u0080\u00932002 (OR, 1.44; 95%CI, 1.00, 2.07), and a relative odds of 1.27 (95%CI, 0.98, 1.64) for meeting milk and milk-alternatives recommendations. The remaining policy was retrieved through a grey literature search that described a different nutrition policy in schools in the Eastern District of Prince Edward Island, which aimed to address student nutrition among elementary and high school students. RESULTS: One intervention was evaluated using the School Health Action Planning and Evaluation System survey, which is conducted by the province. Since 2008, a provincial survey involving students in grades 5\u00e2\u0080\u009312 from more than 50 schools (depending on the year) have collected data and reported dietary intake practices during the weekday among the sample. Over the years, the survey data have shown a higher proportion of students consuming fast food and junk food compared with the proportion of students consuming healthier options. Each survey year, approximately 40% of boys and girls reported consuming fruits and vegetables at least 6 times on the day before the survey, and 70% or greater of boys and girls reported eating fast food and junk food the day before. RESULTS: Summary of results: Quebec RESULTS: A total of 21 articles were included that reported information from Quebec, of which 18 were peer-reviewed articles and 3 were grey literature documents (see Table\u00e2\u0080\u0089S13 in the Supporting Information online). Of these, 3 were policy documents 3 were observational studies unrelated to a program or policy, and 6 were unique interventions (reported in 15 articles) that used the following study designs for evaluations: RCT (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00891), QES (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00895), observational study (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00896), or secondary analysis (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00891). The quality of these studies were assessed as serious RoB (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00891) for the RCT; moderate RoB (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00892) and serious RoB (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00893) for the QES; and low risk (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00893), low-moderate risk (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00894), and moderate risk (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00891) for the observational studies. Three policy and program documents were retrieved from the grey literature that discussed Quebec\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Framework Policy on Health Eating and Active Living; school food policies; and a guide for the education community to build healthy schools. No reviews specific to Quebec school food and nutrition policies and programs were identified. RESULTS: All 3 observational studies assessed school food environments across Montreal, Sherbrooke, Richmond, and Valcourt, specifically in relation to food sold to students and the presence of food programs in low SES areas. For instance, schools with the most unhealthy food environment were associated with greater student central adiposity (\u00ce\u00b2\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00892.01 [95%CI, 0.83, 3.20]; P\u00e2\u0080\u0089<\u00e2\u0080\u00890.01) compared with healthier schools (\u00ce\u00b2\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00891.26 [95%CI, 0.27, 2.26]; P\u00e2\u0080\u0089<\u00e2\u0080\u00890.05). Furthermore, adolescents attending schools with a food program were significantly more likely (P\u00e2\u0080\u0089<\u00e2\u0080\u00890.0001) to be living in low-income households and food insecurity was more prevalent among students attending schools with a food program compared with those without (12.7% vs 10.4%; P\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00890.22). RESULTS: A third of the articles related to interventions and nonevaluated programs (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00897) specifically discussed the Kahnawake Schools Diabetes Prevention Program. This multicomponent community program targeted grades 1\u00e2\u0080\u00936 from 2 elementary schools in the rural Mohawk community of Kahnawake outside of Montreal. Since the program\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inception in 1994, more than 400 students have participated annually, for free, in its nutrition-related activities, such as in-class nutrition education, the implementation of a health nutrition policy, breakfast provisions, healthy food preparations and tastings, the promotion of traditional Indigenous foods, and other community events. Despite this, repeated cross-sectional measures from 1994 (baseline) to 2002 showed increased risk of having higher BMI and skinfold thickness over time. Intake of key high-sugar foods (for 2002 relative to 1994, adjusted OR, 0.29; 95%CI, 0.21, 0.39) and high-fat foods (for 2002 relative to 1994, adjusted OR, 0.35; 95%CI, 0.25, 0.47) decreased each year; however, fruit and vegetable intake also decreased (for 2002 relative to 1994, adjusted OR, 0.25; 95%CI, 0.18, 0.35). RESULTS: A total of 8 schools across the province implemented an intervention following L\u00e2\u0080\u0099Approche \u00c3\u0089cole en Sant\u00c3\u00a9, an HPS equivalent, with the objective to develop healthy school teams composed of community members to guide improvements to the schools\u00e2\u0080\u0099 food and nutrition curriculum and environment. The remaining 2 interventions were identified near urban centers: the Team Nutriathalon program in 12 schools across Quebec City, and the Petit Cuistots (Little Cooks) program across 8 schools in Montreal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most disadvantaged neighborhoods. Both were multicomponent and primarily provided some form of nutritional education meant to improve student\u00e2\u0080\u0099s food consumption of fruits and vegetables, using eating plans for students between grades 5 and 8 and cooking classes for students between kindergarten and grade 6. RESULTS: KAP-related effectiveness outcomes were identified in 3 studies and the most common outcome among all program evaluations. The Petits Cuistots program alone resulted in significant positive impacts on students\u00e2\u0080\u0099 knowledge of food nutrient content (P\u00e2\u0080\u0089<\u00e2\u0080\u00890.001), perceived cooking capacity (P\u00e2\u0080\u0089<\u00e2\u0080\u00890.05), and attitudes toward tasting uncommon foods (P\u00e2\u0080\u0089<\u00e2\u0080\u00890.001) compared with control groups. An intervention program conducted in 2010 also was aimed to encourage students to stay in school during lunch by hosting cooking sessions, interactive after-school conferences, and rewarding participants with recipe books and food containers. However, whether this program has continued long term is unknown. The following equity indicators were used to disaggregate data: age (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00892), sex (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00896), and SES (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00892). RESULTS: Summary of results: Saskatchewan RESULTS: Seventeen articles specific to Saskatchewan were identified, which included 3 unique interventions (reported in 6 articles), 1 nonevaluated program (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00895 articles), 1 observational study (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00891 article), and 4 policies or guidelines (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00895 articles) (see Table\u00e2\u0080\u0089S14 in the Supporting Information online). The majority of included studies (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u008913) were identified through the grey literature. Peer-reviewed studies (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00894) represented approximately 2480 participants in grades 1\u00e2\u0080\u00939 from 18 schools; 1 study looked at meal programs over a decade, during which the number and ages of participants, and number of schools varied. Two studies were conducted in elementary schools, 1 in high schools, and 1 included a combination of both. RESULTS: All interventions and nonevaluated programs identified targeted nutrition as the sole component, with modifications aimed at the food environment (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00892), food behaviors (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00891), or both (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00891). The majority of programs were free to students (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00893); the 1 exception to this was a study that assessed milk programs in 6 schools, of which 2 required students to purchase milk. Two studies were conducted in urban settings and 1 in a mixed urban and rural setting. The 3 interventions were assessed via peer-reviewed study and reported outcomes, including dietary outcomes (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00894) and KAP (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00891). Two articles disaggregated data by an equity indicator, namely urban or rural location and sex. In 1 article, researchers reported on an observational study conducted over 10\u00e2\u0080\u0089years to evaluate the nutritional content of meals served by the Child Hunger and Education Program School Nutrition Program in Saskatoon. Although macronutrient standards were typically met, mean energy and dietary fiber content values were significantly below standards (P\u00e2\u0080\u0089<\u00e2\u0080\u00890.05), and sodium content was significantly above standards (P\u00e2\u0080\u0089<\u00e2\u0080\u00890.05) in most years. No formal evaluation was available on the Saskmilk program, a school milk program that supports registered schools distribute and provide milk and dairy products to students. In the 2021\u00e2\u0080\u00932022 school year, more than 200 schools were part of this program. RESULTS: Two interventions were evaluated experimentaly, both of which used a QES design and were assessed as having serious RoB. Fluids Used Effectively for Living was a 6-week intervention conducted in Saskatoon and Prince Albert that engaged peer educators to enhance the nutrition knowledge and self-reported behaviors of grade-9 students. Although SSB intake significantly decreased after the intervention and at 3-month follow-up (P\u00e2\u0080\u0089<\u00e2\u0080\u00890.02) in 1 of the 2 peer educator\u00e2\u0080\u0093led intervention classes, this could not be sustained after 1 year. No significant changes were observed related to nutrition knowledge, and student satisfaction was mixed across the intervention and self-taught control classes. Furthermore, a 12-week study in Saskatoon involving 280 students attending elementary schools with milk programs found that total milk intake decreased by 12.3% when chocolate milk was removed and plain milk remained (mean \u00c2\u00b1 SE, 26.6%\u00e2\u0080\u0089\u00c2\u00b1\u00e2\u0080\u00895.2% to mean \u00c2\u00b1 SE, 14.31%\u00e2\u0080\u0089\u00c2\u00b1\u00e2\u0080\u00891.6%; P\u00e2\u0080\u0089<\u00e2\u0080\u00890.001). Milk intake was significantly higher among students in rural areas (P\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00890.035) and those who received milk for free (P\u00e2\u0080\u0089<\u00e2\u0080\u00890.001) compared with students in urbans areas and those who paid for milk, respectively. RESULTS: Only 1 study assessed the food environment, specifically comparing the nutritional quality of school meals with meals brought from home. Lunches brought from home contained significantly more calories (P\u00e2\u0080\u0089<\u00e2\u0080\u00890.005) and more calories from minimally nutritious foods (P\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00890.000) compared with lunches provided by school meal programs. Additionally, diet quality was significantly higher on average (P\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00890.000) among students from schools with a meal program compared with those without, further supporting the potential nutritional benefits of school meal programs. RESULTS: Five policy documents were retrieved in the grey literature search that referred to 4 policies: (1) Nutrition Guidelines for Schools, (2) Nourishing Minds\u00e2\u0080\u0093Nutrition Policy Development in Saskatchewan Schools, (3) Healthy Foods for My School: Nutrition Standards for Saskatchewan Schools, and (4) a Food for Thought School Nutrition Policy. The Nutrition Guidelines for Schools were developed by the Saskatchewan School Boards Association in collaboration with the Public Health Nutritionists of Saskatchewan Working Group. These guidelines aimed to strengthen awareness of the associations between nutrition, health, and school performance to provide a resource to analyze current school nutrition practices and policies, and to provide a framework to develop school nutrition policies if they do not already exist. The Nourishing Minds\u00e2\u0080\u0093Nutrition Policy Development in Saskatchewan Schools highlights a comprehensive school community health approach to improving school nutrition and was developed by the Government of Saskatchewan. The Healthy Foods for My School was developed by the Government of Saskatchewan as a tool to help students and schools choose better food and beverages and improve the school food environment in accordance with the Nourishing Minds nutrition policy. RESULTS: Summary of results: Yukon, Northwest Territories, and Nunavut RESULTS: There was a dearth of information pertaining to Canada\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 3 territories. Only 7 articles specific to any of the territories were found and only 2 were peer-reviewed (see Tables\u00e2\u0080\u0089S15\u00e2\u0080\u0093S17 in the Supporting Information online). Two nonevaluated programs were identified (reported in 3 articles), 1 in Northwest Territories and 1 occurring in both Northwest Territories and Nunavut; and 4 policy documents were found that referred to nutrition policies in Nunavut and the Yukon or examined the implementation of a food school policy in a Canadian Artic school. One program, the Drop the Pop campaign, was a nutrition behavior\u00e2\u0080\u0093based initiative aimed to reduce consumption of SSBs and teach students in all grade levels how to make healthier choices. Moreover, the implementation of a traditional food program in schools in Inuvik, Northwest Territories, was described. This program modified both food behaviors and the food environment by promoting knowledge of and skills applicable to traditional foods, and preparing nutritious snacks. Unfortunately, neither of these programs was evaluated nor were any effectiveness outcomes reported. The Government of Nunavut released a framework to address nutrition in schools, and Yukon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s government released 2 documents that outlined an SNP and guidelines for sales of home-prepared foods within schools. No nutrition reviews or food environment studies specific to any of the territories were identified. DISCUSS: DISCUSSION DISCUSS: The purpose of this narrative systematic review was to synthesize and appraise evidence on Canadian school food and nutrition interventions, programs, and policies, and their impact on diets and nutritional status among school-aged children and adolescents. We assessed primary studies within the peer-reviewed and grey literature to provide a holistic picture of current school food environments in local, provincial, and multiregional settings. To contextualize results within the broader food systems concept, we discuss the evidence as it relates to the political, social, and physical environments, as well as the impact on individual food choice, dietary behaviors, and nutritional status. We also provide 5 key recommendations (Panel 1) based on the summary of findings. TABLE: Recommendations to Improve School Food and Nutrition in Canada TABLE: 1. Improve interdisciplinary collaboration between the health and education sectors to design, implement, monitor, and evaluate existing and new interventions and programs to ensure they meet current nutritional guidelines and produce intended nutritional outcomes among youth. This should include collaboration within and between provincial ministries in order to develop comprehensive and standardized indicators to ensure provincial guidelines can be monitored routinely and evaluated comparably.\t \t2. Consider the multifactorial context that influences the nutrition and health lifestyle choices and practices in children and adolescents, including systemic, institutional, parental and family, societal and peer influences, and individual choice.\t \t3. Greater community and stakeholder engagement for better design and infrastructure of policies and programs, especially amongst programming for Indigenous populations given current evidence indicates sustainability and success is associated with community involvement. This will include the participation of parents and guardians, students, teachers and administration, and other key stakeholders to ensure future programming is tailored appropriately to the populations they aim to serve.\t \t4. Prioritize the use of alternative methods and the assessment of different outcomes, such as behavior change, anthropometric and micronutrient outcomes, to evaluate program effectiveness. Program evaluation should also consider longitudinal evaluations to monitor the long-term effects, impact, and sustainability of these interventions.\t \t5. Future research should examine how the implementation of universal school food and nutrition programs and policies can ultimately ensure healthy diets for those that are predominantly affected by food insecurity and other food system inequities. This includes Indigenous populations, especially situated in the Territories, and other ethnically diverse communities, communities with predominantly low socioeconomic status, and metropolitan regions with large food deserts. DISCUSS: Political environment DISCUSS: Although the federal government recently announced its plan for a national school food policy, to date, there is still no school food or nutrition mandate that exists at the federal level, with the exception of Canada\u00e2\u0080\u0099s food guide. It is also no secret that Canada lags far behind other high-income countries as one of the only Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries lacking a national school food program and policy. In a recent study by Hock et al, youths 10\u00e2\u0080\u009317\u00e2\u0080\u0089years old from Australia, Canada, Chile, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and the United States participated in the International Food Policy Study Youth Survey, which found countries with the most comprehensive national school meal policies (Chile and the United States) had the greatest meal and nutrition coverage across their student populations. This is compared with less-comprehensive national policies in the United Kingdom and Mexico, and no policies in Australia and Canada (only 5% of Canadian students participated in a school meal program). The study also showed that Canada especially fell short among its most vulnerable populations. Hock et al also reported that only 27% of students with the most food insecurity participated in some form of a school meal program, whereas in Chile and the United States, more than two-thirds of their vulnerable student populations accessed a school meal. This highlights the importance and strong influence of national-level food policies on student nutrition and health, which Canada has yet to implement. DISCUSS: In addition to school meal programs, national legislation is also required to address inappropriate marketing of unhealthy products, particularly those targeted at youth, alongside policies that dictate the provision of nutritious and sustainable meals in schools. A 2020 report by the World Health Organization, UNICEF, and Lancet Commission, Children in All Policies 2030, called for a new global initiative to put the health and well-being of children and adolescents at the center of global and national efforts to achieve sustainable development. Of relevance is 1 of the primary objectives of this initiative to protect children of all ages from the harmful impacts of food marketing, which is also reflected in the World Health Organization Set of Recommendations on the Marketing of Foods and Non-Alcoholic Beverages to Children and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. Governments have been repeatedly called upon to restrict unhealthy food and beverage marketing to children and adolescents because this marketing exploits their health and development. However, the only \u00e2\u0080\u009cguidelines\u00e2\u0080\u009d in Canada were implemented in 2007 (by the Canadian Children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative) and stipulated voluntary self-regulation of marketing practices by the food industry. The lack of legislation is largely due to industry stakeholders interacting with the government, such as the recent lobbying against a proposed bill in 2018 (Bill S-228). This is in exception to Quebec\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Consumer Protection Act (1980), which was the first legislation that does not permit commercial marketing to children younger than 13\u00e2\u0080\u0089years on all marketing media and channels. DISCUSS: Despite no federal-level legislation addressing harmful marketing practices, there is clear acknowledgement of the need to improve affordability, accessibility, and advertisement of healthy foods and beverages. Marketing of branded and/or unhealthy food and beverage items, such as chocolate, pizza, and other fast foods, remains pervasive across the country. Adherence to marketing guidelines and policies implemented at the local level is also an area of concern. A study in British Columbia showed that 26% of promotions violated the Board of Education\u00e2\u0080\u0099s advertising policies and only 13% displayed appropriate nutritional messaging. This evidence further raises the issues of regulation, adherence, and compliance when there is absence of official governmental legislation. Although the Association of Canadian Advertisers, the Canadian Beverage Association and Food, Health & Consumer Products of Canada, and Restaurants Canada recently created the \u00e2\u0080\u009cFood and Beverage Advertising Code\u00e2\u0080\u009d to outline marketing conditions that advertisements catered to children are expected to comply with by summer 2023, this, too, is not legislation, and regulation remains unclear. DISCUSS: The lack of federal and provincial (save Quebec) guidance and leadership has placed an onus on school boards, local governance, and other organizations to develop and implement their own policies for in-school advertising and programming and ensure these align with international guidelines. However, the effectiveness and compliance of these local actions are questionable. Our review found that school meal programs were offered at random and based on voluntary local or provincial implementation with no cohesive strategy or standards even within the same province. This is also reflected in the adoption of the HPS approach or its equivalent in Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario, and Nova Scotia. These programs were interpreted and contextualized based on each province to encourage enabling school food environments (eg, APPLE Schools, Healthy Buddies, AS! BC, ANHPSP, Battle River Project, Health Promoting Secondary Schools). To further demonstrate this sheer complexity, in Nova Scotia alone, a smaller province within the country, there were 70 provincial policies and 509 policies across 8 public school regions that were relevant to the HPS framework. This review illustrates that there are numerous policies and programs, with varying designs, implementation strategies, and mixed results in terms of their effectiveness on improved behaviors, diets, or nutrition, making meaningful comparison between programs or policies, and provinces and territories extremely challenging. Likewise, a multiregional survey using a representative sample of high school students from 7 provinces (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u008912\u00e2\u0080\u008a110) found that neither healthful nor nonhealthful eating behaviors differed significantly between schools with voluntary (OR, 0.83; 95%CI, 0.64, 1.08) and mandatory (OR, 1.16; 95%CI, 0.83, 1.64) nutrition policies. DISCUSS: Ultimately, there is a patchwork of provincial and local actions that has developed over the years that govern and influence the Canadian school food environment. Given the vastness of the country and the diversity of populations, settings, and governance structures, schools have implemented a wide range of food environment and nutrition policies according to their individual missions and student needs, including direct provision, safeguards against marketing branded or highly processed foods and beverages, school meal standards, and nutrition education. DISCUSS: Physical environment DISCUSS: In addition to political factors, a key area of change and beneficial impact in the school food environment is improving the physical space through food availability and accessibility, and the physical infrastructure and capacity of schools to provide food and beverages. Across Canada, 7 provincial guidelines have been released on the nutritional profile of foods and beverages provided in schools, with many being updated since the release of the 2019 food guidelines for Canada. Although a recent and comprehensive school food environment assessment has yet to be conducted across Canada, Browning et al surveyed 436 primary and secondary schools in 2013 to understand food access within and around schools, as well as availability of healthy food options. Their findings suggest that although schools had access to a cafeteria, shop, or vending machine, the provision of healthy options was greatest in cafeterias (89.3% of schools) and lowest in vending machines (41.3%), and only 39.9% of schools had access to fruits and vegetables. DISCUSS: Assessing food availability and accessibility beyond the supply and distribution of food to schools remains an important consideration, given school-based nutrition interventions strictly providing food provisions have had insignificant impacts on children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s home food environment, home fruit and/or vegetable availability, and parental modelling of fruit and/or vegetable consumption. The present review suggests that, with the exception of the provision of school snacks or meals, changes to the physical environment and their effect on outcomes of interest, like dietary intake and anthropometry, were limited in the published literature. Only 8 interventions explicitly mentioned implementing some form of an environmental change other than food provisions. This included improving existing infrastructure and equipment or constructing new infrastructure, such as school gardens. Other changes involved introducing school-wide bans of high-fat and high-sugar foods and restricting the sale of foods in vending machines and canteens to healthier snack and beverage options. However, the majority of these interventions and programs were implemented in conjunction with behavioral changes, such as nutrition education, whereas only 2 interventions altered the food environment alone. Interestingly, all the studies that altered the food environment indicated some improvement, either significant or insignificant, to overall nutritious food preferences, fruit and vegetable intake, fat and fiber intake, non-SSB intake, and anthropometric measures, such as obesity, waist circumference, body fat percentage, and BMI, when compared with baseline or groups who were not exposed to environmental changes. DISCUSS: Similar to Colley et al, the majority of studies in this review used multicomponent interventions, consisting of both a behavioral component (eg, a nutrition education program) and an environmental component, defined as any policy or physical change to the environment (including infrastructure and resources). None of the studies disaggregated outcome data on the basis of the discrete behavioral and environmental components, limiting the ability to analyze and understand the environment-specific effects on nutrition outcomes in this age group. Single-component interventions mostly implemented behavioral components, such as nutritional education, that were incorporated into existing curriculum or peer-, family-, and/or community support. Notable high-quality evidence was identified in Ontario and Quebec, where changes to the curriculum resulted in improved fruit and vegetable intake by kindergarten and grade 5\u00e2\u0080\u00936 participants. In comparison, notable high-quality evidence of multicomponent interventions mostly was found in western Canada, where student\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dietary intake and BMI improved significantly after the implementation of nutrition education, food provisions, physical activity, and community-based initiatives in Alberta and British Columbia. DISCUSS: Social environment DISCUSS: Although schools varied in terms of their school food and nutrition initiatives and infrastructure, key barriers to the participation, acceptance, and sustainability of interventions, programs, and policies were attributed to social factors. The most common barrier was staff capacity, which led to inconsistencies in implementation and added stress on staff. Logistical challenges also prevented the availability, sourcing, and delivery of resources due to natural causes, financial constraints, and the loss of leadership and support. DISCUSS: Although meaningfully intended, school food and NPs that are specifically geared toward students in need can contribute to stigma and social exclusion of students and families experiencing food insecurity or those of lower SES when it is made obvious who is receiving meals. This may influence participation and momentum. Needs-based programs in which students and families must identify that they are food insecure or have lower SES may be counterproductive because those in need may be too shy, embarrassed, or proud to sign up. Although this finding may suggest that a universal program, instead of a needs-based one, would increase uptake, evidence in the literature suggests this may not always be guaranteed. Godin et al reported a 16% student participation rate despite offering universal breakfast programs in Ontario and Alberta. Muthuswamy et al also showed that perception is a strong factor that can significantly influence participation among students. Some fears of stigma include fear of being labeled, judged, or laughed at; teased for using meal programs; or standing out among their peers of higher SES or those with greater food security. Some of this stigmatization could also be resolved with better communication between the school or programs and students and their families. Miscommunication or a lack of communication between parents/guardians and the school about the purpose of the programs, what the programs offer, and how they work led to decreased participation rate. This is a common theme reported in the literature. DISCUSS: It is also important to consider how culture and ethnicity affect food choice and participation in these programs. Misalignment between nutrition recommendations and cultural preferences of participants and their parents can affect participation. This is seen in both Indigenous and non-Indigenous groups. This is similar to other evidence in both Canada and the United States showing that cultural appropriateness of food and cultural practices of students and their families can affect participation, regardless of need. Muthuswamy et al and Skinner et al recommend involving student input on food preferences and options in school cafeterias and meal or snack programs to improve acceptance and participation. DISCUSS: On the other hand, a key element that helped program sustainability and policy implementation was community engagement and establishing strong relationships with the community. These relationships and networks served as a resource for valuable input and voluntary support. This was especially common among the Indigenous-specific studies included, which noted key factors for successful program implementation were the involvement of Indigenous Elders and Knowledge Keepers, and building relationships and communication between stakeholder groups throughout the design and implementation phases. In alignment with the aforementioned barriers, successful implementation was also found in programs that had adequate access to resources, funding, and consistent leadership. DISCUSS: Key takeaways DISCUSS: The first key takeaway from this review is that program evaluation is inconsistent and challenging across the country. Not only is existing research and evaluation of programs and policies disproportionate across the provinces and territories, they are also largely concentrated in certain areas, such British Columbia, Ontario, and Alberta, with limited research conducted in the Territories and among Indigenous student populations. Important to note, however, is that the evidence base is rapidly evolving. A 2021 analysis of school food programs in Canada highlighted that 100% of schools in the Northwest Territories and Nunavut and 94% of schools in Yukon have school food programs, with an 87% student participation rate. However, these programs, along with other community-based programming and initiatives, are not rigorously evaluated or documented, especially in Indigenous communities, and as such, may have been absent in our literature search. This may lead to gaps in research and records reviewing these programs and their effects, and a lack of generalizability of program evaluations, given limited comprehensive representation of the student populations across the country. DISCUSS: The second key takeaway is that given the lack of federal-level policy or legislation that outlines standards and procedures, local and individualized development of programs and policies reflects immense heterogeneity in demographics, geography, and scale (ie, local or provincial/territorial), which contributes to differences in design, methodology, and implementation. These include infrastructural indicators (eg, presence of lunch programs, types of food and beverages offered in school cafeterias); KAP of school administration, teaching staff, and students; anthropometry; dietary intake; physical activity; health practices; educational gains; and academic performance. Some programs chose one or all of these measures in their design and evaluations. Given the different student populations by province or territory, cultural and ethnic groups, and urban and rural settings, it is expected that programs differ by design and implementation to best address the needs and community reflected in particular settings. Programs may also differ in their duration, which adds further complexity to the ability to evaluate effectiveness. For example, even when schools adopted the HPS framework in the design phase, the selection of core HPS components to be included were not necessarily standardized or uniformly implemented, with each school interpreting and contextualizing the framework to fit their needs and criteria. This makes it difficult to compare and contrast programs, even those under the same framework, because current programs are often administered voluntarily and operated at the discretion of individual school capacities. DISCUSS: The third key takeaway is that this review highlights the strong dependency of current research on latent construct indicators such as KAP, with few using observable biophysical indicators, such as micronutrient deficiencies and anthropometry. The most commonly reported effectiveness outcomes were dietary intake and KAP measured through quantitative surveys or qualitative interviews, which, in both cases, relied on self-reporting. Although KAP can capture key information about student acquisition of knowledge or changes in attitudes and perspectives after an educational-based intervention, there are limitations to its use. First, KAP surveys can be difficult to interpret without a benchmark or standard reference to classify KAP among the study participants. This standard reference might be achieved by comparison with a similar KAP survey conducted in a similar population with similar methods; however, realistically, this is not always possible, especially among the variable school food programs and policies that are evaluated across the country. In addition, we found in through review that health knowledge did not necessarily translate into sustained behavior changes. Significant improvements in student knowledge among participants exposed to health literacy programming concerning Canada\u00e2\u0080\u0099s food guidelines did not translate into significant changes in food behaviors, such as vegetable intake. Even when positive food behavior changes were identified immediately after assessment, these short-term impacts were often short-lived after follow-up assessments, ranging from 2\u00e2\u0080\u0089months to 7\u00e2\u0080\u0089years, showed insignificant changes in programs across the country. Most importantly, healthy eating is a much more complicated concept beyond acquiring adequate literacy to guide individual decision-making. Conducting holistic and intersectional investigations should require careful examinations of obesogenic environments, geographic location, family income, and other ecological determinants. DISCUSS: Strengths and limitations DISCUSS: Overall, this review is strengthened by the breadth and depth of the literature examined using systematic methods and evolving evidence that corroborates our findings. The wide heterogeneity and low quality of experimental study designs (ie, single or multicomponent interventions, duration, randomization, outcomes assessed) did not allow for a formal meta-analysis. Given this, all relevant studies, regardless of quality and RoB, were included in this narrative review. As well, physical activity\u00e2\u0080\u0093focused programs and policies that did not have an explicit food and nutrition component were not included in this review. This may have excluded studies and evaluations that may have had an indirect impact on children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s overall nutrition and dietary behaviors. Measurement tools used in observational study designs were also highly variable and often study-specific. High-quality measurement methods are required to conduct assessments and evaluations of the school food environment to not only offer comparable data but also to better inform future policies and practices that can lead to improved diets and nutritional status. CONCL: CONCLUSION CONCL: Canada remains the only Group of Seven country without a national school meal program, with 1 in every 20 students in Canada missing lunch on a given school day. In 2021, Canada\u00e2\u0080\u0099s federal government committed to developing a national school food policy. However, beyond this, multidisciplinary and concerted efforts across the provinces and territories at both the local and provincial/territorial levels are needed to address the multiple threats to food and nutrition security our children and adolescents face. CONCL: We found that the Canadian school-based food environment literature remains largely heterogeneous and is primarily focused on nutrition education and physical activity programs that use self-reported data that are measured through quantitative and or qualitative methods to infer changes in children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nutrition. A minority of literature evaluates programs and policies connected with equity-seeking groups, despite these populations being closely associated with food insecurity. Few evaluated no-cost food provision programs, which could be owing to researcher preference or that, unfortunately, only 5% of students in Canada are covered by a school food program. This is a key area that the incoming national school food policy and future research and evaluations must address. The recent COVID-19 pandemic and current increasing inflation and food costs have exposed and possibly exacerbated already existing inequities in food systems and food environments. Even prior to the pandemic, the evidence was clear that Indigenous communities and marginalized and racialized populations are especially vulnerable to food insecurity and are unable to meet the recommendations of Canada\u00e2\u0080\u0099s food guidelines. CONCL: Schools are a critical entry point to shaping nutrition-promoting behaviors, and this review provides much-needed evidence on school food and nutrition interventions, programs, and policies in Canada. We report in this review rich evidence on key facilitators and barriers to implementation and sustainability of programs provided by stakeholders, while also uncovering important evidence gaps that require careful examination for future evaluations. National, provincial, and local governments should design multisectoral policies and programs with equity in mind to ensure vulnerable and marginalized groups can access or achieve a sufficient, diverse, nutritious diet that is culturally appropriate and aligns with Canada's food guidelines and jurisdictional nutrition standards. Importantly, in consultation with local communities, programs must be tailored to context and cuisine to ensure maximal acceptance and engagement.

    "Title": "Promoting healthy school food environments and nutrition in Canada: a systematic review of interventions, policies, and programs",
    "Abstract": "Abstract Context The school food environment is a critical interface for child and adolescent nutrition, and there is a need to understand existing literature on Canadian school food environments to identify equity gaps and opportunities, and empower decision-makers to plan for future action. Objective Literature on Canadian school food and nutrition interventions, policies, programs, and their effects on diets and nutritional status are synthesized and appraised in this systematic review. Data Sources A search strategy was developed for each database used (Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, ERIC, Cochrane Collaboration, Canadian Electronic Library, BiblioMap), with a combination of free text and controlled vocabulary, for articles published from 1990 to 2021. Unpublished data and grey literature were also searched. Data Extraction Quantitative and qualitative studies with an observational or intervention study design, reviews, or program evaluations conducted in Canadian schools with participants aged 5\u00e2\u0080\u009319.9\u00e2\u0080\u0089years were included. Key study characteristics and risk of bias were extracted independently by 2 investigators using a standardized tool. Data Analysis A total of 298 articles were included (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u0089192 peer reviewed and 106 from the grey literature), which were mostly conducted in Ontario (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u008952), British Columbia (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u008943), and Nova Scotia (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u008928). Twenty-four interventions, 5 nonevaluated programs, and 1 policy involved Indigenous populations. Overall, 86 articles measured and reported on effectiveness outcomes, including dietary intake; anthropometry; knowledge, attitudes, and practices; and physical activity. The literature remains largely heterogenous and primarily focused on nutrition education programs that use subjective assessments to infer changes in nutrition. A key facilitator to implementation and sustainability was community engagement, whereas key barriers were staff capacity, access to resources and funding, and consistent leadership. Conclusions This review provides insight into Canadian school food and nutrition interventions, programs, and policies and uncovers important evidence gaps that require careful examination for future evaluations. Governments must create supportive environments that optimize nutrition for children and adolescents through equitable policies and programs. Systematic Review Registration PROSPERO registration no.

    "INTRO": "INTRODUCTION With 6 years remaining to end hunger, food insecurity and all forms of malnutrition (United Nations\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Sustainable Development Goal 2), global progress has regressed. Importantly, the greatest burden of malnutrition is shouldered by children and adolescents from the poorest and most marginalized communities, due to suboptimal food environments and diets. Like other high-income countries, food environments in Canada do not support the consumption of accessible, affordable, sustainable, nutritious, and healthy food. In fact, the majority of Canadian children and adolescents do not meet national dietary guidelines, and diet quality is poor. In addition, at least 1.4 million Canadian children experience food insecurity, and childhood obesity rates have doubled over the past 40\u00e2\u0080\u0089years. With the recognition that early-life nutrition has life-long health and social implications, there have been global efforts to redesign, promote, and integrate multisectoral interventions across the life course and the continuum of care. The integration of nutrition within health, education, and social protection delivery platforms has been recognized as a critical opportunity to realize child and adolescent human rights to food and nutrition security. Schools are considered innovative platforms for life course interventions, especially for optimizing nutrition. Launched in the 1980s, the \u00e2\u0080\u009cHealth Promoting School\u00e2\u0080\u009d (HPS) approach (or \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhole-school approach\u00e2\u0080\u009d) was developed by the World Health Organization. The approach focuses on a broad spectrum of policies, program activities, and services that contribute to the health, safety, and well-being of students, staff, and families, while assuring a supportive and enabling environment that nurtures academic growth and development. The concept of health promotion in schools has been adopted at different scales with varying approaches, such as the Comprehensive School Health Program in Canada, which comprises 8 components that relate to the following broader political, physical, and social contexts: health education, school-based health services, the school environment, physical education, food services, student counselling, staff health promotion, and community integration. A key aspect is improving the school food environment, which refers to the spaces and conditions inside and around school premises where food and beverages are available, obtained, purchased, and/or consumed, with consideration of nutritional content, promotion, pricing, and food safety. Although there are limited data on what interventions, policies, and programs can effectively improve school food environments and, ultimately, the nutrition of children and adolescents in Canada, evidence from recent systematic reviews suggests that school-based nutrition interventions can have a positive effect on dietary outcomes, including fruit and vegetables intake. However, these effects are not necessarily actualized in changes to anthropometric outcomes, like body mass index (BMI). As such, our aim in conducting this systematic review was to synthesize and appraise literature on the Canadian school food environment and nutrition interventions, policies, and programs, and their effects on diets and nutritional status, while identifying research gaps, particularly for equity-seeking populations, and opportunities to empower decision-makers to plan for future action.",
    "METHODS": "METHODS Our search was conducted on December 20, 2021, for publications from the year 1990 to the present without language restrictions or search filters (ie, by population or outcome) within the following databases: MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, ERIC, Cochrane Collaboration, the Canadian Electronic Library (ie, Canadian Public Policy Collection, and the Canadian Electronic Library), Canadian Health Research Collection, and BiblioMap (the EPPI-Centre database of health promotion research) (see Table\u00e2\u0080\u0089S1 in the Supporting Information online). Search strategies were developed for each database along with free text and controlled vocabulary (ie, Medical Subject Heading terms). Additional search terms were included in consultation with an information specialist. Key search terms included the following: school health services, school nutrition, health promotion, and school policies. Our protocol was registered with PROSPERO (no. CRD42022303255). A search for unpublished data and grey literature that met eligibility criteria was conducted. Some of the electronic databases we searched include a combination of published and unpublished studies. To ensure maximum coverage of unpublished literature and reduce the potential for publication bias, organizational websites and databases were searched using a keyword search in the area of food security and nutrition (see Table\u00e2\u0080\u0089S2 in the Supporting Information online). Where possible, we consulted technical experts regarding unpublished data discussed in webinars, newsletters, and other media sources. Reference lists of relevant systematic reviews, commentaries, and editorials were hand searched to find other eligible studies. We included quantitative and qualitative studies conducted in Canada that had an observational study design (ie, cross-sectional, cohort, case-control, and ecological studies), interventional study design (ie, randomized controlled trials [RCTs], quasi-experimental studies [QES], intermittent time series, and controlled before-after studies), reviews (ie, systematic, literature, and scoping), or program evaluations. We included participants aged 5\u00e2\u0080\u009319.9\u00e2\u0080\u0089years (preschool, primary, middle, or high school). Studies that included participants outside of this age range and did not report disaggregated data were excluded (Table\u00e2\u0080\u00891). We evaluated included studies based on the RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance) framework that were focused on intervention, nonevaluated programs, or policy implementation. Importantly, adoption relates to the absolute number, proportion, and representativeness of interventions, nonevaluated programs, and policies adopted within provinces or territories. Reach relates to the absolute number, proportion, and representativeness of schools or individuals who participate in a given intervention or nonevaluated program or are affected by a policy. Implementation refers to the fidelity to various elements of an intervention, nonevaluated program, or policy, including consistency of delivery as intended. Importantly, it also includes adaptations made to interventions and implementation strategies. For the purposes of this study, key elements were changes to the school food environment, including food accessibility, food availability, and food promotion, as well as implementation barriers and facilitators. Maintenance refers to the long-term effects (\u00e2\u0089\u00a56\u00e2\u0080\u0089months) of an intervention, policy, or nonevaluated program on outcomes after it is completed either at the setting (institutionalization) or individual (retention of effectiveness) level. Effectiveness relates to the impact of an intervention, nonevaluated program, or policy on important individual outcomes, including potential negative effects, and variability across subgroups (generalizability or heterogeneity of effects). In this review, we considered the following outcomes, which were author defined, under effectiveness on individuals: direct measures of consumption (ie, frequency of consumption, energy intake, macronutrient and micronutrient intake, food group intake, food consumption score, portion size); direct measures of diet quality (ie, food security, diet diversity score, meal score, Healthy Eating Index, other diet quality indices, diet adequacy); diet-related biomarkers (ie, micronutrient deficiencies); anthropometry (ie, nutritional status); physical activity; and education (ie, changes to knowledge, attitudes, and practices [KAP]). We considered any interventions, nonevaluated programs, policies, regulations, and guidelines that affected the political, social, and physical school food and nutrition environment, including interventions for food availability, accessibility, policy, pricing, and promotion. For example, we included studies related to the provision of foods, including meals (breakfast, lunch, or dinner) or snacks consumed at school (hereafter, in-school feeding), and foods distributed to the family and consumed outside of the school setting (hereafter, take-home ration). We also included studies examining the economic (ie, price of healthy and unhealthy food items recorded, children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s spending restriction) and sociocultural (ie, behavioral interventions such as food and nutrition education) school environments. There was no minimum duration of follow-up for inclusion. Studies conducted in schools were eligible for inclusion. Studies and reports that used data from multiple countries, including Canada, were required to report disaggregated data by country to be included in this review. Our primary outcomes were used as eligibility criteria for including studies (ie, if a study did not report any of the primary outcomes, it was excluded). However, we did not exclude studies on the basis of how that outcome was reported (ie, that an effect size is not estimable although the outcome was clearly measured). We excluded animal studies, conference abstracts, and letters or comments. Data collection We assessed study eligibility starting with title and abstract screening of all unique records identified by our search strategy. Once duplicates were removed, all records were uploaded into Covidence (Melbourne, VIC, Australia). Title and abstract screening was conducted by 3 independent reviewers (B.C., E.K., G.D.). Records were assessed according to the following exclusion criteria: incorrect topic area, ineligible document type, and duplicate document. Full article text was found for all eligible studies and uploaded into Covidence. These were screened by 2 reviewers (G.D., E.K.) using the following exclusion criteria: incorrect topic area, incorrect population, ineligible document type, duplicate document, or no primary outcomes. Disagreements between the 2 reviewers were resolved by a third independent reviewer (B.C.). Data from all eligible texts that proceeded to full-text extraction were extracted by 2 reviewers according to the following domains: general information, study setting and population, primary outcomes, and secondary outcomes. Because we expected variability in reported age bands, we made a post hoc decision in analysis of results at different age bands. Extracted data were matched by 2 independent reviewers (E.K., G.D., C.O., or R.J.), with any conflicts resolved by a third reviewer (B.C.). We attempted to contact authors of the original reports to obtain further details if required. Risk of bias Given the various study designs, we assessed the risk of bias (RoB) through different tools: for observational studies, the National Institutes of Health Quality Assessment Tool for Cohort and Cross-sectional Studies was used; for intervention studies, the Cochrane\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Risk of Bias Tool; for nonrandomized controlled trials, we used Risk of Bias in Nonrandomized Studies of Interventions tool; and for systematic reviews, A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews was used. Studies were scored by 2 independent review authors (E.K., G.D.). Each study was assigned an overall quality score, classified as low, low-moderate, moderate, moderate-serious, and serious. Scores from the 2 independent reviewers (E.K., G.D.) were compared and a final score was determined. In case of disagreements, a third review author (B.C.) was consulted. Data synthesis We forecasted that a meta-analysis would not be possible because of the scope of the study research questions and the range of outcome measures and methods. We narratively synthesized the findings that emerged. Results were summarized first on the basis of geography (ie, by province or territory) and then by study design (ie, RCT, QES, or observational), RoB assessment and impact on primary and secondary outcomes. For each extracted outcome, we analyzed the association on the basis of its effect estimate (odds ratio [OR] or risk ratio [RR]), confidence interval (CI), and whether the finding was statistically significant (P\u00e2\u0080\u0089\u00e2\u0089\u00a4\u00e2\u0080\u00890.05). Additionally, results were contextualized on the basis of social stratification (ie, by age, sex, socioeconomic status, geography, and ethnicity), using the Nutrition Equity Framework as guidance, as well as the broader political, physical, and social contexts that are key elements in the World Health Organization HPS.",

Recommendations to Improve School Food and Nutrition in Canada 1. Improve interdisciplinary collaboration between the health and education sectors to design, implement, monitor, and evaluate existing and new interventions and programs to ensure they meet current nutritional guidelines and produce intended nutritional outcomes among youth. This should include collaboration within and between provincial ministries in order to develop comprehensive and standardized indicators to ensure provincial guidelines can be monitored routinely and evaluated comparably.\t \t2. Consider the multifactorial context that influences the nutrition and health lifestyle choices and practices in children and adolescents, including systemic, institutional, parental and family, societal and peer influences, and individual choice.\t \t3. Greater community and stakeholder engagement for better design and infrastructure of policies and programs, especially amongst programming for Indigenous populations given current evidence indicates sustainability and success is associated with community involvement. This will include the participation of parents and guardians, students, teachers and administration, and other key stakeholders to ensure future programming is tailored appropriately to the populations they aim to serve.\t \t4. Prioritize the use of alternative methods and the assessment of different outcomes, such as behavior change, anthropometric and micronutrient outcomes, to evaluate program effectiveness. Program evaluation should also consider longitudinal evaluations to monitor the long-term effects, impact, and sustainability of these interventions.\t \t5. Future research should examine how the implementation of universal school food and nutrition programs and policies can ultimately ensure healthy diets for those that are predominantly affected by food insecurity and other food system inequities. This includes Indigenous populations, especially situated in the Territories, and other ethnically diverse communities, communities with predominantly low socioeconomic status, and metropolitan regions with large food deserts.",
    "RESULTS": "RESULTS Summary of results The search strategy retrieved 24\u00e2\u0080\u008a163 records comprising 23\u00e2\u0080\u008a825 peer-reviewed articles and 320 grey literature documents, and 14 articles that were identified through reference searching. Among the articles retrieved from databases, 17\u00e2\u0080\u008a949 articles underwent title and abstract screening. Thirteen articles published in French were screened and translated by a bilingual research assistant, and 6 of these were included in the screening. Of the 451 articles that underwent full-text review, 267 were excluded for the following reasons: wrong outcomes (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u0089126), wrong study design (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u008969), wrong setting (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u008940), wrong population (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u008924), wrong intervention (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00896), wrong time frame (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00891), or could not be retrieved (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00896). A total of 192 peer-reviewed studies were included in this review (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u0089178 from database and 14 from reference-list searching). Of the 320 grey literature articles that were screened, 187 underwent full-text review, and 106 were included. Overall, a total of 298 articles were included (Figure 1). For the purposes of this review, interventions were defined as any formal programs or initiatives that were observationally or experimentally evaluated by a peer-reviewed study. In comparison, nonevaluated programs refer to any program document either peer-reviewed or captured through grey literature that were not evaluated observationally or experimentally. Most of the literature was specific to Ontario (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u008952), British Columbia (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u008943), and Nova Scotia (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u008928); the fewest records were specific to the 3 territories, namely the Northwest Territories (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00893), Nunavut (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00892), and the Yukon (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00892). Approximately 10 systematic and 27 narrative reviews were also included, of which only 21 were specific to Canada, and the remaining 16 discussed food policies and programs internationally and included Canada. All included studies indicated the adoption of an intervention (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u008963, reported in 117 articles), a nonevaluated program (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u008942, reported in 48 articles), policy (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u008948, reported in 74 articles), and/or observed an unspecified program or policy (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u008922) related to school food and nutrition across Canada. In total, 192 articles specified reach, whether at the population, school, or community level. Implementation outcomes were identified in 134 articles; the outcomes were dominated by measures pertaining to implementation experiences, the school environment, and other cost-related factors. There were 86 articles in which effectiveness was measured for the following outcomes: anthropometry (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u008925), dietary intake (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u008956), KAP (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u008953), and changes in physical activity (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u008923). Given the heterogeneity of the programs, populations, and outcomes, meta-analyses could not be conducted to assess the effect on diets and nutritional status. However, among the 60 unique articles that evaluated dietary intake and/or anthropometric outcomes, 21 found a statistically significant positive change, 16 found no effect, 12 found mixed effects depending on outcome, and in 11, significance was unclear (see Figure\u00e2\u0080\u0089S1 in the Supporting Information online). In addition, 166 articles clearly indicated maintenance and sustainability of the intervention, nonevaluated program, and/or policy. Although these studies clearly note maintenance beyond 6\u00e2\u0080\u0089months at the time of publication, there are limited data available to confirm whether these initiatives have continued to the present day. A breakdown of all RE-AIM components by province is provided in Table\u00e2\u0080\u00892, and characteristics of included studies are presented in Table\u00e2\u0080\u00893. A total of 17 interventions (reported in 31 articles), 4 nonevaluated programs (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00897 articles), 2 reviews (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00892 articles), and 1 policy (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00893 articles) were specifically conducted with Indigenous populations or communities in Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, and the 3 Territories. In addition, 7 interventions (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u008917 articles) and 1 nonevaluated program (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00893 articles) explicitly mentioned the inclusion of Indigenous participants, among other ethnic populations, in Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, and Ontario. Four interventions (reported in 12 articles) were specifically implemented in low socioeconomic status (SES) areas in Alberta, Ontario, and Quebec, and 1 observational study (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00895 articles) also investigated school food environments in similar economically-disadvantaged communities in the Atlantic provinces. Summary of results: multi-regional Of the 298 articles included in this review, 62 articles reported data from multiple regions in Canada, of which 58 were peer-reviewed studies and 4 were from the grey literature (see Table\u00e2\u0080\u0089S4 in the Supporting Information online). Most of the peer-reviewed studies were reviews (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u008937) that were either systematic (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u008910) or narrative (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u008927). Of these, 14 reviews focused on compiling information on interventions, 22 reviews compiled information on policies, and 1 review investigated both programs and policies. The quality of the systematic reviews ranged from having critically low (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00896) to low (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00892) and moderate (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00892) RoB. Only 1 peer-reviewed study disaggregated data, using age and geographical location as equity indicators. Four unique interventions (reported in 8 articles), 5 policy documents (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00895 articles), 8 observational studies (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00898 articles), and 2 nonevaluated programs (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00894 articles) were included. The interventions were either single-component (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00892) or multicomponent (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00892) initiatives and programs, and were evaluated using QES (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00892) or observational (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00896) designs. Some single-component initiatives were the Kids Shop Smart Tour (nutrition education component only) in Alberta and British Columbia, and breakfast and lunch programs implemented in Newfoundland, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia that provided food to children between 5 and 12\u00e2\u0080\u0089years old located in poor, disadvantaged neighborhoods. Some multicomponent programs were part of the FitSpirit programs in Quebec and Ontario (nutrition education and physical activity component specifically for adolescent girls), and the Indigenous Youth Mentorship Program was developed to promote health through snack provisions and peer support for 13 Indigenous communities across the country. Two observational studies surveyed school food environments across all provinces and territories by identifying the presence of food programs and healthy food initiatives, which included hosting cooking classes, implementing media literacy education, and creating access to a school cafeteria, retail stores, and/or vending machines. Two studies used cross-sectional data from the Cannabis, Obesity, Mental Health, Physical Activity, Alcohol, Smoking, Sedentary Behaviour (COMPASS) study to evaluate policy compliance. One study reported a lack of adherence of nutritional policies with respect to vending machines within schools. The other study used cross sectional student and school-level data that explored adolescent dietary behaviors in relation to open- and closed-campus policies. Students who attended closed-campus-policy schools reported eating lunch purchased from fast food outlets and restaurants and drinking sugar-sweetened beverages on fewer weekdays, though consumed snacks from school vending machines on more weekdays compared with students at open-campus schools. One study explored the influence of mandatory versus voluntary provincial school nutrition policies (SNPs) on student eating behaviors as part of the 2015 Cancer Risk Assessment in Youth Survey. The study found that, overall, neither \u00e2\u0080\u009chealthful\u00e2\u0080\u009d nor \u00e2\u0080\u009cnon-healthful\u00e2\u0080\u009d eating behaviors differed significantly between schools with voluntary and mandatory nutrition policies. All 4 grey literature documents discussed breakfast programs provided to elementary and high school students in multiple regions across the country, such as those run by the Breakfast Club of Canada. In 2018\u00e2\u0080\u00932019, the Breakfast Club of Canada involved 1809 schools across the country, including 269 schools among Indigenous communities. The School Breakfast Program, through the Grocery Foundation, helps various student nutrition programs (NPs) across the country purchase healthy food for reduced costs by partnering with industry stakeholders, companies, and others. Summary of results: Alberta A total of 24 articles were included that reported data from Alberta. These included 21 peer-reviewed studies and 3 grey literature documents (see Table\u00e2\u0080\u0089S5 in the Supporting Information online). Of these, 10 were unique interventions (reported in 16 articles), 3 nonevaluated programs (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00892 articles), 3 policies (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00895 articles), and 1 observational study (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00891 article). No reviews specifically investigating programs and policies in Alberta were identified. The 10 unique interventions were conducted as QES (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00896) or program evaluations (observational studies) (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00895), with additional program documents and secondary or modelling analyses (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00895). Three of the included QES were assessed as having serious RoB (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00893) and 3 had moderate RoB (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00893),; the observational studies were assessed as having low (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00893), low-moderate (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00891), and moderate (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00891) RoB. Fifteen studies measured and reported on implementation, and 11 studies assessed effectiveness, including anthropometric measures (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00894), dietary intake (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00896), physical activity (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00895), and KAP of students (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00898). One intervention program reported in several articles is the Alberta Project Promoting Active Living and Healthy Eating (APPLE) Schools program, which was originally implemented in schools in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods, including those in Indigenous communities. APPLE Schools has since expanded to British Columbia, Manitoba, and the Northwest Territories, where estimates indicate that almost 30\u00e2\u0080\u008a000 students from 87 elementary and junior high schools benefit from the program within a given year. It is multicomponent by design, with particular focus placed on nutrition education to improve healthy eating habits, physical activity, and mental well-being. Evidence from 2012 reported an average of 0.55 more servings of fruits and vegetables (95%CI, \u00e2\u0080\u00930.02, 1.13; not significant) and 212.11 fewer calories per day (95%CI, \u00e2\u0080\u0093315.07, \u00e2\u0080\u0093109.16; P\u00e2\u0080\u0089<\u00e2\u0080\u00890.05) among students in APPLE schools compared with those attending other schools. However, in the long term, no differences in knowledge, attitudes, self-efficacy, diet, physical activity, and weight status were observed among APPLE School graduates compared with non-APPLE School graduates, which suggests an overall equalizing effect for these disadvantaged populations. The remaining interventions were located in Calgary (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00893), Camrose and its surrounding counties (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00891), the Alexander First Nation community (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00892), and other school partners across the province. All were conducted in elementary and junior high schools. Nutrition education and gardening were key components in several interventions to improve health literacy and behaviors. Some interventions were multicomponent and included physical activity (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00891) or food provisions (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00893), such as milk and snacks. However, only the snack programs were provided at no cost. Despite students having to pay for milk provisions, the calcium (1423 vs 1344\u00e2\u0080\u0089mg) and vitamin\u00e2\u0080\u0089D (10.8 vs 9.7\u00e2\u0080\u0089\u00c2\u00b5g) intake among grade 6\u00e2\u0080\u009312 students participating in the Alberta School Milk Program significantly increased compared to those who did not partake in the program. This program is 1 of only 2 studies in which data were disaggregated on the basis of equity indicators, specifically age, geographical location, and SES. Only 1 observational study unrelated to a policy or program was identified in Alberta. That study specifically investigated the Alexander First Nation school food environment by assessing the health quality of foods available to students. The researchers found that although schools provide breakfast, lunch, and concession foods, healthy options remain limited. Three food and nutrition policies in Alberta schools were identified. One study investigating a policy in an Alexander First Nation school found several barriers that prevented adequate policy adherence, such as inconsistent implementation, staff uncertainty about the lack of school communication with parents, and perceived misalignment between nutrition recommendations and traditional Indigenous foods in the community. An evaluation of an SNP used a mixed-methods design that included a semi-structured interview to capture First Nations parents' perceptions and to identify facilitators and barriers to policy implementation. Nearly all parents (95%) responded in support of the policy, and 93% believed it was important for their children to have healthy food choices at school. This study reported a few barriers to policy implementation, including lack of support for guidelines concerning celebrations and fundraisers, inadequate communication, and cost availability and accessibility of healthy food. As well, although parents were aware and in support of the policy, none demonstrated a comprehensive understanding of the policy content. Parents also reported the high cost and low availability and accessibility of healthy foods in the community hindered their ability to provide healthy foods for their children at home. Summary of results: British Columbia A total of 43 articles were included data from British Columbia. These included 26 peer-reviewed studies and 17 grey literature documents (see Table\u00e2\u0080\u0089S6 in the Supporting Information online). The articles represent 10 unique interventions (reported in 21 articles), 5 policies (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u008910 articles), 5 observational studies unrelated to any policies or programs (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00895 articles), and 7 nonevaluated programs (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00897 articles). No reviews related to food and nutrition policies or programs specific to British Columbia were found. Two interventions were conducted on Vancouver Island; the remaining 8 varied by location across the province. These interventions were evaluated using the following designs: RCTs (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00893), QES (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00895), secondary analyses (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00891), and observational studies (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u008912). The RCTs were assessed as either having serious (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00892) or moderate (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00891) RoB, whereas most of the QES had serious (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00894), or moderate (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00891) RoB. The Action Schools! BC (AS! BC) program involved 39 school districts in unspecified metropolitan centers; its AS! BC First Nations adaptation was implemented in 3 schools in the rural and Indigenous communities of the Tsimshian Nation. Similarly, the Healthy Buddies program was implemented in 45 schools across the Sunshine Coast region, and its Healthy Buddies First Nations adaptation was also implemented in 2 schools in the Tsimshian Nation communities. The Learning for Life Program was implemented in 3 schools: 1 with an inner-city immigrant population, 1 with a rural and Indigenous population, and 1 was a predominantly European regional center. The remaining Health Promoting Secondary Schools program was conducted in 5 schools on the lower mainland and Vancouver Island. Among these, the intervention and Learning for Life program were single-component studies (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00892) with a particular focus on providing nutrition education alone to improve literacy and promote healthy lifestyle behaviors. The remaining interventions were multicomponent (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00896), combining a nutrition component, often through food provisions and in-class lessons, with a physical activity component. Altogether, these interventions were free and supported more than 1600 students, ranging from kindergarten to grade 12. The majority of studies assessed KAP outcomes (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u008910), such as changes in health literacy from the Learning for Life program, identifying a significant increase (P\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00890.009) immediately after implementation, but reported that scores significantly decreased (P\u00e2\u0080\u0089<\u00e2\u0080\u00890.001) after 2 months despite the majority of participants reporting consistent efforts to maintain healthy lifestyle changes. Anthropometric (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00897) and dietary intake (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00899) outcomes were also measured, although results varied. For instance, the AS! BC program found significant increases (P\u00e2\u0080\u0089<\u00e2\u0080\u00890.05) in fruit and vegetable consumption after 12\u00e2\u0080\u0089weeks, which differed from the outcomes of the AS! BC First Nations adaption, which found no significant impact on daily consumption of fruits and vegetables, or sugar and sweetened beverages (SSBs) by their Indigenous population. Surveys of Vancouver schools identified that most schools in the region had healthy food available and implemented relatively new food-related learning activities; however, student participation remained low. Equity indicators were also used to disaggregate data by age (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00894) and sex (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00892). The majority of the grey literature reporting data from British Columbia provided comprehensive summaries and/or guidelines for the respective policies and programs; a few publications reported evaluations of interventions. A major provincial program is the Healthy Schools BC government initiative, which helps support health education and provides partnerships between various government ministries, health authorities, schools, and community partners with the primary aim to create healthier school environments. Many subprograms, such as the Fruit and Vegetable Nutritional program and Farm to School program, are funded through Healthy Schools BC. One evaluation was completed in 503 schools across the province among school-aged children and adolescents (kindergarten to grade 12). Only 3.8% of the schools had a policy emphasizing the types of food and beverage products sold within schools. Of the schools that regularly provided meals or snacks, 62.8% provided breakfast and 63.7% provided snacks. Another provincial evaluation conducted in 2019 revealed that only half of students regularly ate breakfast on school days. Compared with the results of the 2013 survey, there was a slight decrease in the percentage of students who consumed fruits and vegetables at least once on the day prior to completing survey. To examine school-level changes associated with implementation of the Food and Beverage Sales in Schools and daily physical activity guidelines in British Columbia, elementary, middle school, and high school principals were asked to complete a survey on the school food and physical activity environment in 2007\u00e2\u0080\u00932008 (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u0089513) and 2011\u00e2\u0080\u00932012 (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u0089490). In 2011\u00e2\u0080\u00932012, 66% reported full implementation of guidelines for vending machines, followed by 45%, 36%, 10%, and 8% for snack bars, cafeterias, fundraising activities, and special events, respectively. A realist evaluation was conducted using semi-structured interviews (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u008923), structured questionnaires (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u008962), participant observations at public events (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00893), and scans of school, school district, and health authority (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u008967) websites across 5 public school districts. Four mechanisms influencing the implementation of British Columbia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s school food and beverage sales policy were identified: (1) mandatory mechanism, (2) scofflaw mechanism, (3) economic mechanism, and (4) resource constraint mechanism. Summary of results: Manitoba Twenty-one articles specific to Manitoba were identified, comprising 6 peer-reviewed studies and 15 grey literature documents (see Table\u00e2\u0080\u0089S7 in the Supporting Information online). These included 4 unique interventions (reported in 6 articles); 4 policies, guidelines, and recommendations (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u008911 articles); and 4 nonevaluated programs (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00894 articles). The 6 peer-reviewed studies represented approximately 773 students in grades 1\u00e2\u0080\u009312; 1 study did not report the number students included. A total of 520 schools were included; however, 1 study accounted for 498 of these schools. Four studies were conducted in elementary schools, 1 in a middle school, and 1 included schools with grades 7 or higher. Of the 15 documents from the grey literature search, 7 pertained to the government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s provincial \u00e2\u0080\u009cMoving Forward with School Nutrition\u00e2\u0080\u009d policies and guidelines. These documents outline guidelines on how to establish, facilitate, and evaluate various programs to promote a healthier school food environment. Four interventions and 1 nonevaluated program were multicomponent, integrating nutrition programming with physical activity (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00893), anatomy (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00891), and antismoking (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00891) initiatives. Six studies addressed food behaviors, 2 modified the food environment, and 1 implemented a combination of the 2. Youth mentors were engaged for 2 interventions to facilitate the education of younger students. Five were free to students; 2 did not specify if there was a charge. Four interventions and nonevaluated programs were conducted in mixed urban and rural settings, 3 were conducted in exclusively urban settings, and 1 in rural settings. The Healthy Buddies intervention and 1 nonevaluated program were created specifically with Indigenous children in mind; in 1 additional study, approximately 28.3% (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u0089183 of 647) of the included participants identified as First Nations members, although the program was not intentionally created for this population. Two interventions disaggregated data by an equity indicator, specifically, age (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00892), sex (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00892), and rural or urban geographic location (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00892). Of the 4 evaluated interventions, 1 used an observational study design. Specifically, this study analyzed cross-sectional data to observe changes in enrollment in Home Economics Food and Nutrition courses for grades 7\u00e2\u0080\u009312 from 2000 to 2010 and found that enrollment increased over the course of the study (from 25.67% to 29.75%), with the largest increases reported in northern and remote areas; however, enrollment in these areas was still slightly lower compared with Winnipeg by 2010. Despite these findings, interviews with school staff (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u008913) revealed that the sustainability of Home Economics Food and Nutrition courses faces notable challenges due to being undervalued in school settings in favor of other courses, and due to dissonance between Home Economics Food and Nutrition teachings and changing social norms toward a culture of fast food and fewer family meals. Three interventions were evaluated with an experimental study. Two were RCTs of moderate and serious quality, and 1 was a QES of moderate quality. Interventions ranged from 2\u00e2\u0080\u0089weeks to 22\u00e2\u0080\u0089months and included approximately 736 students, aged 6 to 13\u00e2\u0080\u0089years, from 21 schools. All interventions were assessed quantitatively ; 1 used qualitative data as well. One intervention reported on anthropometry and dietary changes, and the remaining 3 interventions reported KAP, including health knowledge scores (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00891), positive development (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00891), and attendance (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00891). Healthy Buddies is a school-based nutrition, physical activity, and body image health promotion program that was introduced by Manitoba\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Healthy Schools Initiative in 2009 after adapting the pilot program that originated in British Columbia. Throughout the 2009\u00e2\u0080\u00932010 school year, teachers provided weekly healthy-living lessons to older students (aged 9\u00e2\u0080\u009312\u00e2\u0080\u0089years), who then acted as peer mentors to teach 30-min weekly lessons to their younger \u00e2\u0080\u009cbuddies\u00e2\u0080\u009d (6\u00e2\u0080\u00938\u00e2\u0080\u0089years). Students pairs also received 2 30-minute aerobic fitness sessions per week. A total of 19 elementary schools (incorporating 10 interventions and 9 control) and 647 students were included in the trial. Intention-to-treat analyses indicated that waist circumference significantly decreased in the intervention group relative to the control group (between group difference, \u00e2\u0080\u00931.60\u00e2\u0080\u0089cm; 95%CI, \u00e2\u0080\u00932.28, \u00e2\u0080\u00930.91; P\u00e2\u0080\u0089<\u00e2\u0080\u00890.001), particularly for children who were overweight or obese or attending First Nations schools. Multivariable analyses (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u0089311) further revealed significant reductions in boys, children from lower-income situations, and children living in rural areas (P\u00e2\u0080\u0089<\u00e2\u0080\u00890.05). Changes in BMI z-scores were not significantly different between groups (P\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00890.55) or within any subgroup. Self-reported food and drink intake, and nutrition knowledge significantly improved among younger students in the intervention group compared with the control group (P\u00e2\u0080\u0089<\u00e2\u0080\u00890.05) but not for older students. In comparison, the Lifestyles Board Game was an educational intervention aimed to increase children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s knowledge of anatomy, nutrition, and lifestyle risk factors for noncommunicable diseases among a class of grade 6 students (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u008923) in Winnipeg. After playing the board game twice, 2 weeks apart, overall knowledge scores significantly improved (P\u00e2\u0080\u0089<\u00e2\u0080\u00890.05) on a post-test in the intervention group compared with the control group. Moreover, the Heart Experts and Research Team intervention was a school-based youth development program that spanned 2 school years and involved 26 students, aged 12 to 13\u00e2\u0080\u0089years, from a middle school in an urban setting. Students received 6 in-class intervention sessions, including a healthy food workshop and a heart-healthy research workshop, that were designed to enhance students\u00e2\u0080\u0099 knowledge and team-building and leadership skills. Positive Youth Development scores did not significantly improve after the intervention compared with baseline; however, focus group findings revealed positive health behavior changes and increased self-efficacy related to cardiovascular health. Although the program was well received, staff and students were less motivated during the second year of the intervention and indicated preference for a shorter program with greater intensity. Summary of results: New Brunswick Eight articles specific to New Brunswick were found (see Table\u00e2\u0080\u0089S8 in the Supporting Information online). These included 5 policies, guidelines, and frameworks (reported in 5 articles) and 3 nonevaluated programs (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00893 articles). Seven of these documents were from the grey literature and did not formally evaluate the policies and programs discussed. Three nonevaluated programs were reported in documents retrieved through the grey literature search: the New Brunswick Healthy Learners in School Program, Mango Mania initiative, and the program run through Le R\u00c3\u00a9seau des caf\u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9rias communautaires Inc. and the Really Local Harvest cooperative. The Healthy Learners in School Program is a provincial program established in 2000 that coordinates health promotion and prevention activities in classrooms and schools. The Mango Mania initiative is a population-health, community-based program conducted in schools that promote healthy lifestyle habits, including healthy eating, physical activity, and screen-time restrictions. The program run by Le R\u00c3\u00a9seau des caf\u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9rias communautaires and the Really Local Harvest intended to promote healthy food procurement and eating habits. Five policies, guidelines, and frameworks were identified; however, only 1 was assessed in a scientific study, and this was the only peer-reviewed study specific to New Brunswick that was included in the review. Researchers conducted semi-structured interviews with 50 participants at the provincial, district, and school levels during 1997\u00e2\u0080\u00931999. The current perception of the Food and Nutrition Policy for New Brunswick Schools is that it is a \u00e2\u0080\u009cgoodwill\u00e2\u0080\u009d policy implemented at the discretion of individual schools. When the policy was first proclaimed, it led to much controversy that caused the department to retreat from full implementation. Opposition centered around 4 issues: (1) profit from food sales, (2) student choice, (3) policy interpretation, and (4) policy implementation. Priority of nutrition ranged from low to high among school responses. Examples of low priority of nutrition were the pressure to increase literacy and math levels, nutrition is not an issue for the public, disagreement with the nature of the policy, and other issues had a much higher priority. High priority reasons of nutrition included that a principal was on the district of the nutrition committee and wanted to be a trendsetter, a principal worked with the food-service provider after teachers and parents raised concerns, the district called for change, and the school decided to make significant changes. Summary of results: Newfoundland and Labrador Six articles specific to Newfoundland and Labrador were identified, comprising 3 peer-reviewed studies and 3 grey literature documents (see Table\u00e2\u0080\u0089S9 in the Supporting Information online). These represented 2 unique interventions (reported in 3 articles) and 2 policies and guidelines (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00893 articles). Of the 2 unique interventions, 1 was conducted in middle schools and 1 in elementary schools. These studies included approximately 146 students and 100 school personnel. Only 1 study reported the number of schools of included (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00893). All interventions and nonevaluated programs were offered free to students, and 1 was multicomponent and included elements of physical activity. One program operated in both urban and rural settings and 1 did not disclose its setting(s). Two interventions reported KAP outcomes; however, neither was able to assess dietary or anthropometric measures. One study used an observational study design to assess the implementation of Children Aiming to Choose Health, a resource toolkit designed to help educators promote healthy behaviors in a learning environment. At the time of the follow-up survey in winter of 2009, the majority (55%) of educational facilitators had yet to use the toolkit since its dissemination in the fall of 2008, indicating time constraints and limited access to toolkits between classrooms as the main barriers of use. Still, 44% of total respondents reported observing positive changes in children since the resource kit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s introduction; however, students were not assessed to support this finding. One intervention was experimentally evaluated and used a QES design that was assessed to have serious RoB. This study assessed the impact of a cardiovascular health education program, which included 7 45-minute in-school health education classes on cardiovascular health knowledge among 146 grade-8 students. Knowledge scores increased from baseline for both the urban and rural intervention groups; however, this improvement was only significant for the latter group (degrees of freedom\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u008942; Tukey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s test, \u00ce\u00b1\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00892.98). The program was well received among rural students: 86.4% (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u008919 of 22) found the program informative and 68.2% (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u008915 of 22) would recommend its inclusion into their regular health education classes. Student satisfaction was not assessed for in urban schools, and the study did not assess dietary or anthropometric outcomes. Two provincial guidelines were identified through the grey literature search: School Food Guidelines for School Food Providers and the Eating Healthier in Newfoundland and Labrador Provincial Food and Nutrition Framework and Action Plan. The first guideline document provided information to school providers with regard to what food and beverage products should be sold in schools and how to serve healthier meals and snacks. These guidelines were updated in 2008 to reflect the revised Canada\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Food Guide. The second guideline document provided a broader framework for the province to provide children and youth healthier food through school food programs. Summary of results: Nova Scotia Twenty-eight articles specific to Nova Scotia were identified, of which 14 were peer-reviewed and 14 were grey literature documents (see Table\u00e2\u0080\u0089S10 in the Supporting Information online). These included 2 unique interventions (reported in 10 articles), 1 of which was evaluated by 3 separate groups of researchers, 2 nonevaluated programs (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00892 articles), 10 policies and guidelines (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u008914 articles), and 2 observational studies unrelated to a specific policy or program (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00892 articles). Four studies used data from the Children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Lifestyle and School Performance Study, a cross-sectional provincial study that assessed nutrition, physical activity, mental health, and academic performance among grade-5 students in Nova Scotia who were exposed to a HPS program in 2003 and 2011. Approximately 13\u00e2\u0080\u008a874 participants in grades 4\u00e2\u0080\u00937 were included across 3 sources; 3 studies or sources did not collect data from students and conducted assessments at the school level. In total, 878 schools were included, the majority of which (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u0089693\u00e2\u0080\u0093737) were elementary schools. Of the 4 unique interventions and nonevaluated programs, all were multicomponent, combining strategies to modify food behaviors (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00894) and/or the food environment (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00893) with physical activity initiatives. All were free to students and the majority were conducted in mixed urban and rural (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00893), with 1 conducted in an urban community only. Two interventions were evaluated and the following outcomes were reported: dietary intake (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00895), physical activity (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00895), anthropometry (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00894), and KAP (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00892). No studies disaggregated data by an equity indicator. One of these programs implemented the HPS framework adapted from recommendations by the World Health Organization used to guide the implementation of multicomponent health promotion interventions in schools. Three derivatives of HPS interventions in Nova Scotia were discussed in 10 documents, including 9 peer-reviewed studies. Five articles assessed general HPS initiatives throughout Nova Scotia, 1 assessed HPS in the Tri-County Regional School Board area, and 3 assessed the Annapolis Valley Health Promoting Schools Project (AVHPSP) in Annapolis Valley. Six articles used an observational study design and 1 conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis. In 2011, 5\u00e2\u0080\u0089years after the province-wide introduction of HPS in Nova Scotia in 2006, of 269 elementary schools across the province, 71.8% provided health education in line with HPS practices, 66.4% had a healthy school environment, and 63.1% had a subsidized food program, of which 72.9% adhered to nutrition policies. Of the schools that sold food, 82.3% adhered to nutrition policies and 59.1% priced healthy foods competitively. Despite these findings, the prevalence of obesity and diet quality scores among grade-5 students were not significantly different compared with data from 2003, before the province\u00e2\u0080\u0099s introduction to HPS. In the rural Tri-County Regional School Board area, a qualitative study involving 18 elementary schools found that schools implementing a HPS approach had greater quantity and quality of visual promotions for healthy eating compared with non-HPS schools. In terms of accessibility, processed foods were more available in non-HPS schools; however, these schools also had more resources for food produce (ie, school gardens). This same study found that students in grades 4\u00e2\u0080\u00936 attending HPS schools had nonsignificantly higher Diet Quality Index\u00e2\u0080\u0093International z-scores, on average, than students from non-HPS schools (mean \u00c2\u00b1 SD, 0.04\u00e2\u0080\u0089\u00c2\u00b1\u00e2\u0080\u00890.99 vs mean \u00c2\u00b1 SD, \u00e2\u0080\u00930.07\u00e2\u0080\u0089\u00c2\u00b1\u00e2\u0080\u00891.02). HPS programs appeared to have a positive impact in Annapolis Valley as reported by a cross-sectional study involving 5200 grade-5 students from 282 schools. This study compared anthropometric and dietary outcomes between schools implementing the AVHPSP with schools using other NPs and no NPs, and found that all measured nutrition-related outcomes were in favor of the NP component of the AVHPSP. Additionally, rates of overweight (OR, 0.41; 95%CI, 0.32, 0.53) and obesity (OR, 0.28; 95%CI, 0.14, 0.57) were significantly lower among students from schools implementing the AVHPSP compared with schools without a NP, and nonsignificantly lower than among students from schools with a different NP. Schools implementing the AVHPSP also reported comparatively more fruit and vegetable consumption (AVHPS, 6.7 servings/day; other NP, 5.8 servings/day; no NP, 5.7 servings/day), better diet quality (Diet Quality International-I score: AVHPSP, 64.5; other NP, 62.1; no NP, 62.3), and less dietary fat intake as a proportion of total calories (AVHPSP, 29.4%; other NP, 30.3%; no NP, 30.3%). Only 1 intervention was experimentally evaluated and used a QES design that was assessed to have serious RoB. The Dartmouth Health Promotion Study assessed the Coordinated Approach, an intersectoral health promotion education strategy that spanned the community and schools. The included study assessed the school-based health curriculum component with 2 cohorts of students initially in grade 4, over 3\u00e2\u0080\u00934 years, and found no significant improvements in heart-health knowledge scores compared with control schools. A total of 14 documents reported on the implementation of school and nutrition policies, guidelines, recommendations, and curriculum directives, of which 4 studies formally evaluated policy implementation with a cross-sectional study design. A study by McIssac and colleagues (2019) assessed the current-state assessment of policy implementation and adherence. Adequacy and capacity for food policy implementation were used to assess policy adherence through the availability of prohibited \u00e2\u0080\u009cminimum\u00e2\u0080\u009d nutrition foods. Overall, 237 schools were included, spanning primary grades and kindergarten to high schools, with an average of 332 students and 33 staff per school. Schools reporting above-average facilities and perceived adequacy and capacity for policy implementation had greater odds of adhering to a lunch policy (OR, 3.62; 95%CI, 1.56, 8.40), whereas schools that adhered to a snack and lunch policy had lower odds of serving quick-service foods (OR, 0.48 [95%CI, 0.23, 1.01]; and OR, 0.18 [95%CI: 0.08, 0.41], respectively). The Grow Eat Learn program is a province-wide program that supports and grows school food gardens to encourage healthy eating and lifestyle habits among students, and for the school environments to be successful and sustainable. The provincial government in 2006 established an official Food and Nutrition Policy for Nova Scotia Public Schools, which includes standards for food and beverages provided in public schools and a provincial breakfast program. The provincial government also released guidelines for nutrition-focused curricula for grades 8 and 12, phasing out fast foods in schools and fundraising and replacing with healthy food and beverages. One observational study assessed the school food environment through a secondary analysis of a cross-sectional study. Interviews with 23 principals, teachers, and volunteers, from 9 elementary schools, involved in NPs revealed that NPs may not be addressing the root causes of food insecurity and, instead, may be contributing to health inequities. Qualitative findings specifically revealed that the latter may occur through the negative impact of NPs on the stigmatization and social exclusion of families with food insecurity. Summary of results: Ontario A total of 52 articles were included that reported information on Ontario, including 37 peer-reviewed and 15 grey literature documents (see Table\u00e2\u0080\u0089S11 in the Supporting Information online). We identified 21 unique interventions (reported on in 30 articles), 11 nonevaluated programs (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u008914 articles), 1 policy (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00896 articles), and 2 observational studies (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00892 articles) unrelated to a policy or program were identified. No reviews related specific to the Ontario school food and nutrition context were found. Interventions were formally conducted using RCTs (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00893) or QES (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u008910), or were program evaluations (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00898). Included RCTs were assessed as moderate (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00892) and serious (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00891) RoB. The QES primarily had moderate RoB (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00897) and the remaining 3 had serious RoB. Observational studies, including program evaluations, were assessed as having low-moderate risk (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00898) or low risk (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00898). Of 21 interventions, seven were conducted in rural Indigenous communities in Northern Ontario. The remaining interventions were conducted in urban city centers (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00895), semi-rural communities (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00891), various areas in Southern Ontario (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00895), and unspecified locations in the province (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00893). Altogether, these programs were provided free to students and represent approximately 2016 elementary schools, with the Fresh from the Farm program comprising the majority of 1700 participating schools across the province. Most interventions were also multicomponent (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u008913), with a mixture of either food provisions, nutritional education, physical activity, or other initiatives that engaged teachers, parents, and community members in their programming. The most common component included was food provisions (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00898) to students through breakfast, snack, and/or lunch. Similarly, food provisions were also the most common element among single-component programs (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00894). Nutrition education was identified in 2 studies, as well as an alternative program that changed the school-day schedule to include additional time for snack periods (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00891). The majority of interventions discussed KAP outcomes (reported on in 15 articles), followed by outcomes relating to dietary intake (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u008913), which resulted in significantly positive improvements in fruit and vegetable intake among students. For instance, use of the Everyone Jump program lessons on nutrition, conducted in St. Catherines, significantly improved student knowledge about Canada\u00e2\u0080\u0099s food guide (F(1,252)\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00895.58; P\u00e2\u0080\u0089<\u00e2\u0080\u00890.05); however, this did not significantly affect healthy food behaviors regarding vegetable intake relative to the control group (P\u00e2\u0080\u0089\u00e2\u0089\u00a5\u00e2\u0080\u00890.05). Long-term studies also found that although significant increases in fruit and vegetable consumption may have been found immediately after assessment, the impact was often short-lived considering 1-year follow-up assessments showed insignificant changes. The following equity indicators were used to disaggregate data: age (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00893), sex (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00895), and ethnicity (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00891). Although the 2 observational studies we identified were unrelated to a specific food policy or program, they both provided prevalence outcomes of school NPs. One study found that of 14 elementary schools boards across the province, 91.5% had breakfast programs and 93.3% had snack programs that provided nutritious foods in sufficient quantities. Alternatively, another survey of 22 school NPs in a large, urban region found that although all programs provided breakfast, lunch, and/or snacks for free, food quality and services differed between schools, given programs were voluntary and operated independently from one another. Of the 15 grey literature documents we found, almost all were policy or nonevaluated program documents with general summaries and guidelines, including Ontario\u00e2\u0080\u0099s School Food and Beverage Policy. Some of the provincial programs described include Nourishing Young Minds (a student NP; Ontario\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Student Nutrition Program), a province-wide program that helps schools provide nutritious meals and snacks; and various smaller programs that address healthy eating, nutrition education, and food accessibility, such as the Great Big Crunch, School Food Delivery Program, Ontario\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Student Nutrition Program, Vegetable and Fruit Delivery Program, and Tasty Ontario Tuesdays. Some local programs included classroom gardens, breakfast programs, and student NPs that were run in Ottawa and Toronto. One document reported a program evaluation for the Feeding Our Future program across 7 sites in Toronto, using both quantitative and qualitative methods. Ontario mandated the School Food and Beverage Policy No. 150 as a set of nutritional standards applied to foods and beverages offered for sale in school food venues, at school events, and through NPs. One study used the comprehensive school health framework (social and physical environments; teaching and learning; healthy school policy; and partnerships and services) to describe schools\u00e2\u0080\u0099 support for healthy eating during the implementation phase during 2 time points: 2012\u00e2\u0080\u00932013 and 2014. Twenty schools remained in the \u00e2\u0080\u009caction\u00e2\u0080\u009d category across both time points. The physical environment was well supported (100%), with safe, clean spaces for students to eat. The social environment pillar was the least supported (68%), and healthy eating was not often highly valued, with few schools identifying healthy eating to be a very high (16%) or high (8%) priority. A qualitative study using in-depth, semi-structured interviews aimed to identify local-level factors shaping the implementation of an SNP. Four key emerging themes were identified: (1) economic environment (ie, the cost of healthy food for sale; loss of revenue generation); (2) physical environment (ie, the proximity of schools to off-site food outlets; link between healthy eating and student learning); (3) political environment (ie, the restrictive nature of policy guidelines; role of key stakeholders); and (4) sociocultural environment (ie, the role of stigma; school culture). Summary of results: Prince Edward Island Nine articles specific to Prince Edward Island were included, of which there were 4 nonevaluated programs (Community Food Security and Food Education 2017 Projects, Yum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Food Adventures, Free Milk Day, and Milk Sport) reported in \u00e2\u0080\u00892 articles, 2 policies (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00893 articles), and 1 intervention (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00894 articles) (see Table\u00e2\u0080\u0089S12 in the Supporting Information online). Few primary outcomes were reported because only 2 articles were peer-reviewed. The Community Food Security and Food Education Program is a provincial program that was established by multiple departments of government, including the departments of Agriculture and Fisheries, Health and Wellness, and Education, Early Learning and Culture. The program involves several sub-programs that aim to improve food literacy among communities, community garden projects, and cooperatives to ensure healthy and local food is provided to school-aged children. The Prince Edward Island School Milk Foundation runs several programs that target kindergarten and elementary school students. Yum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Food Adventures is an in-class program that educates about healthy eating according to Canada\u00e2\u0080\u0099s food guide. Free Milk Day and Milk Sport are programs that encourage more dairy consumption as part of healthy eating and lifestyle habits. We identified 3 articles related to school nutrition policies, 2 of which were formal evaluations of the Prince Edward Island School Nutrition Policy using qualitative and QES designs. In 2006, a total of 52 elementary schools implemented the policy. This study compared food consumption using a self-administered validated food frequency questionnaire from 2007 (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u0089555) and a previous survey from 2001\u00e2\u0080\u00932002 (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u0089971). Results showed students in 2007 were twice as likely to report consuming fewer than 3 servings of low-nutrient density foods (OR, 2.14; 95%CI, 1.62, 2.82) and were also more likely to consume the recommended servings of vegetables and fruit than students in 2001\u00e2\u0080\u00932002 (OR, 1.44; 95%CI, 1.00, 2.07), and a relative odds of 1.27 (95%CI, 0.98, 1.64) for meeting milk and milk-alternatives recommendations. The remaining policy was retrieved through a grey literature search that described a different nutrition policy in schools in the Eastern District of Prince Edward Island, which aimed to address student nutrition among elementary and high school students. One intervention was evaluated using the School Health Action Planning and Evaluation System survey, which is conducted by the province. Since 2008, a provincial survey involving students in grades 5\u00e2\u0080\u009312 from more than 50 schools (depending on the year) have collected data and reported dietary intake practices during the weekday among the sample. Over the years, the survey data have shown a higher proportion of students consuming fast food and junk food compared with the proportion of students consuming healthier options. Each survey year, approximately 40% of boys and girls reported consuming fruits and vegetables at least 6 times on the day before the survey, and 70% or greater of boys and girls reported eating fast food and junk food the day before. Summary of results: Quebec A total of 21 articles were included that reported information from Quebec, of which 18 were peer-reviewed articles and 3 were grey literature documents (see Table\u00e2\u0080\u0089S13 in the Supporting Information online). Of these, 3 were policy documents 3 were observational studies unrelated to a program or policy, and 6 were unique interventions (reported in 15 articles) that used the following study designs for evaluations: RCT (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00891), QES (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00895), observational study (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00896), or secondary analysis (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00891). The quality of these studies were assessed as serious RoB (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00891) for the RCT; moderate RoB (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00892) and serious RoB (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00893) for the QES; and low risk (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00893), low-moderate risk (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00894), and moderate risk (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00891) for the observational studies. Three policy and program documents were retrieved from the grey literature that discussed Quebec\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Framework Policy on Health Eating and Active Living; school food policies; and a guide for the education community to build healthy schools. No reviews specific to Quebec school food and nutrition policies and programs were identified. All 3 observational studies assessed school food environments across Montreal, Sherbrooke, Richmond, and Valcourt, specifically in relation to food sold to students and the presence of food programs in low SES areas. For instance, schools with the most unhealthy food environment were associated with greater student central adiposity (\u00ce\u00b2\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00892.01 [95%CI, 0.83, 3.20]; P\u00e2\u0080\u0089<\u00e2\u0080\u00890.01) compared with healthier schools (\u00ce\u00b2\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00891.26 [95%CI, 0.27, 2.26]; P\u00e2\u0080\u0089<\u00e2\u0080\u00890.05). Furthermore, adolescents attending schools with a food program were significantly more likely (P\u00e2\u0080\u0089<\u00e2\u0080\u00890.0001) to be living in low-income households and food insecurity was more prevalent among students attending schools with a food program compared with those without (12.7% vs 10.4%; P\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00890.22). A third of the articles related to interventions and nonevaluated programs (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00897) specifically discussed the Kahnawake Schools Diabetes Prevention Program. This multicomponent community program targeted grades 1\u00e2\u0080\u00936 from 2 elementary schools in the rural Mohawk community of Kahnawake outside of Montreal. Since the program\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inception in 1994, more than 400 students have participated annually, for free, in its nutrition-related activities, such as in-class nutrition education, the implementation of a health nutrition policy, breakfast provisions, healthy food preparations and tastings, the promotion of traditional Indigenous foods, and other community events. Despite this, repeated cross-sectional measures from 1994 (baseline) to 2002 showed increased risk of having higher BMI and skinfold thickness over time. Intake of key high-sugar foods (for 2002 relative to 1994, adjusted OR, 0.29; 95%CI, 0.21, 0.39) and high-fat foods (for 2002 relative to 1994, adjusted OR, 0.35; 95%CI, 0.25, 0.47) decreased each year; however, fruit and vegetable intake also decreased (for 2002 relative to 1994, adjusted OR, 0.25; 95%CI, 0.18, 0.35). A total of 8 schools across the province implemented an intervention following L\u00e2\u0080\u0099Approche \u00c3\u0089cole en Sant\u00c3\u00a9, an HPS equivalent, with the objective to develop healthy school teams composed of community members to guide improvements to the schools\u00e2\u0080\u0099 food and nutrition curriculum and environment. The remaining 2 interventions were identified near urban centers: the Team Nutriathalon program in 12 schools across Quebec City, and the Petit Cuistots (Little Cooks) program across 8 schools in Montreal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most disadvantaged neighborhoods. Both were multicomponent and primarily provided some form of nutritional education meant to improve student\u00e2\u0080\u0099s food consumption of fruits and vegetables, using eating plans for students between grades 5 and 8 and cooking classes for students between kindergarten and grade 6. KAP-related effectiveness outcomes were identified in 3 studies and the most common outcome among all program evaluations. The Petits Cuistots program alone resulted in significant positive impacts on students\u00e2\u0080\u0099 knowledge of food nutrient content (P\u00e2\u0080\u0089<\u00e2\u0080\u00890.001), perceived cooking capacity (P\u00e2\u0080\u0089<\u00e2\u0080\u00890.05), and attitudes toward tasting uncommon foods (P\u00e2\u0080\u0089<\u00e2\u0080\u00890.001) compared with control groups. An intervention program conducted in 2010 also was aimed to encourage students to stay in school during lunch by hosting cooking sessions, interactive after-school conferences, and rewarding participants with recipe books and food containers. However, whether this program has continued long term is unknown. The following equity indicators were used to disaggregate data: age (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00892), sex (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00896), and SES (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00892). Summary of results: Saskatchewan Seventeen articles specific to Saskatchewan were identified, which included 3 unique interventions (reported in 6 articles), 1 nonevaluated program (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00895 articles), 1 observational study (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00891 article), and 4 policies or guidelines (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00895 articles) (see Table\u00e2\u0080\u0089S14 in the Supporting Information online). The majority of included studies (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u008913) were identified through the grey literature. Peer-reviewed studies (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00894) represented approximately 2480 participants in grades 1\u00e2\u0080\u00939 from 18 schools; 1 study looked at meal programs over a decade, during which the number and ages of participants, and number of schools varied. Two studies were conducted in elementary schools, 1 in high schools, and 1 included a combination of both. All interventions and nonevaluated programs identified targeted nutrition as the sole component, with modifications aimed at the food environment (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00892), food behaviors (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00891), or both (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00891). The majority of programs were free to students (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00893); the 1 exception to this was a study that assessed milk programs in 6 schools, of which 2 required students to purchase milk. Two studies were conducted in urban settings and 1 in a mixed urban and rural setting. The 3 interventions were assessed via peer-reviewed study and reported outcomes, including dietary outcomes (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00894) and KAP (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00891). Two articles disaggregated data by an equity indicator, namely urban or rural location and sex. In 1 article, researchers reported on an observational study conducted over 10\u00e2\u0080\u0089years to evaluate the nutritional content of meals served by the Child Hunger and Education Program School Nutrition Program in Saskatoon. Although macronutrient standards were typically met, mean energy and dietary fiber content values were significantly below standards (P\u00e2\u0080\u0089<\u00e2\u0080\u00890.05), and sodium content was significantly above standards (P\u00e2\u0080\u0089<\u00e2\u0080\u00890.05) in most years. No formal evaluation was available on the Saskmilk program, a school milk program that supports registered schools distribute and provide milk and dairy products to students. In the 2021\u00e2\u0080\u00932022 school year, more than 200 schools were part of this program. Two interventions were evaluated experimentaly, both of which used a QES design and were assessed as having serious RoB. Fluids Used Effectively for Living was a 6-week intervention conducted in Saskatoon and Prince Albert that engaged peer educators to enhance the nutrition knowledge and self-reported behaviors of grade-9 students. Although SSB intake significantly decreased after the intervention and at 3-month follow-up (P\u00e2\u0080\u0089<\u00e2\u0080\u00890.02) in 1 of the 2 peer educator\u00e2\u0080\u0093led intervention classes, this could not be sustained after 1 year. No significant changes were observed related to nutrition knowledge, and student satisfaction was mixed across the intervention and self-taught control classes. Furthermore, a 12-week study in Saskatoon involving 280 students attending elementary schools with milk programs found that total milk intake decreased by 12.3% when chocolate milk was removed and plain milk remained (mean \u00c2\u00b1 SE, 26.6%\u00e2\u0080\u0089\u00c2\u00b1\u00e2\u0080\u00895.2% to mean \u00c2\u00b1 SE, 14.31%\u00e2\u0080\u0089\u00c2\u00b1\u00e2\u0080\u00891.6%; P\u00e2\u0080\u0089<\u00e2\u0080\u00890.001). Milk intake was significantly higher among students in rural areas (P\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00890.035) and those who received milk for free (P\u00e2\u0080\u0089<\u00e2\u0080\u00890.001) compared with students in urbans areas and those who paid for milk, respectively. Only 1 study assessed the food environment, specifically comparing the nutritional quality of school meals with meals brought from home. Lunches brought from home contained significantly more calories (P\u00e2\u0080\u0089<\u00e2\u0080\u00890.005) and more calories from minimally nutritious foods (P\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00890.000) compared with lunches provided by school meal programs. Additionally, diet quality was significantly higher on average (P\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u00890.000) among students from schools with a meal program compared with those without, further supporting the potential nutritional benefits of school meal programs. Five policy documents were retrieved in the grey literature search that referred to 4 policies: (1) Nutrition Guidelines for Schools, (2) Nourishing Minds\u00e2\u0080\u0093Nutrition Policy Development in Saskatchewan Schools, (3) Healthy Foods for My School: Nutrition Standards for Saskatchewan Schools, and (4) a Food for Thought School Nutrition Policy. The Nutrition Guidelines for Schools were developed by the Saskatchewan School Boards Association in collaboration with the Public Health Nutritionists of Saskatchewan Working Group. These guidelines aimed to strengthen awareness of the associations between nutrition, health, and school performance to provide a resource to analyze current school nutrition practices and policies, and to provide a framework to develop school nutrition policies if they do not already exist. The Nourishing Minds\u00e2\u0080\u0093Nutrition Policy Development in Saskatchewan Schools highlights a comprehensive school community health approach to improving school nutrition and was developed by the Government of Saskatchewan. The Healthy Foods for My School was developed by the Government of Saskatchewan as a tool to help students and schools choose better food and beverages and improve the school food environment in accordance with the Nourishing Minds nutrition policy. Summary of results: Yukon, Northwest Territories, and Nunavut There was a dearth of information pertaining to Canada\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 3 territories. Only 7 articles specific to any of the territories were found and only 2 were peer-reviewed (see Tables\u00e2\u0080\u0089S15\u00e2\u0080\u0093S17 in the Supporting Information online). Two nonevaluated programs were identified (reported in 3 articles), 1 in Northwest Territories and 1 occurring in both Northwest Territories and Nunavut; and 4 policy documents were found that referred to nutrition policies in Nunavut and the Yukon or examined the implementation of a food school policy in a Canadian Artic school. One program, the Drop the Pop campaign, was a nutrition behavior\u00e2\u0080\u0093based initiative aimed to reduce consumption of SSBs and teach students in all grade levels how to make healthier choices. Moreover, the implementation of a traditional food program in schools in Inuvik, Northwest Territories, was described. This program modified both food behaviors and the food environment by promoting knowledge of and skills applicable to traditional foods, and preparing nutritious snacks. Unfortunately, neither of these programs was evaluated nor were any effectiveness outcomes reported. The Government of Nunavut released a framework to address nutrition in schools, and Yukon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s government released 2 documents that outlined an SNP and guidelines for sales of home-prepared foods within schools. No nutrition reviews or food environment studies specific to any of the territories were identified.",

    "DISCUSS": "DISCUSSION The purpose of this narrative systematic review was to synthesize and appraise evidence on Canadian school food and nutrition interventions, programs, and policies, and their impact on diets and nutritional status among school-aged children and adolescents. We assessed primary studies within the peer-reviewed and grey literature to provide a holistic picture of current school food environments in local, provincial, and multiregional settings. To contextualize results within the broader food systems concept, we discuss the evidence as it relates to the political, social, and physical environments, as well as the impact on individual food choice, dietary behaviors, and nutritional status. We also provide 5 key recommendations (Panel 1) based on the summary of findings. Political environment Although the federal government recently announced its plan for a national school food policy, to date, there is still no school food or nutrition mandate that exists at the federal level, with the exception of Canada\u00e2\u0080\u0099s food guide. It is also no secret that Canada lags far behind other high-income countries as one of the only Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries lacking a national school food program and policy. In a recent study by Hock et al, youths 10\u00e2\u0080\u009317\u00e2\u0080\u0089years old from Australia, Canada, Chile, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and the United States participated in the International Food Policy Study Youth Survey, which found countries with the most comprehensive national school meal policies (Chile and the United States) had the greatest meal and nutrition coverage across their student populations. This is compared with less-comprehensive national policies in the United Kingdom and Mexico, and no policies in Australia and Canada (only 5% of Canadian students participated in a school meal program). The study also showed that Canada especially fell short among its most vulnerable populations. Hock et al also reported that only 27% of students with the most food insecurity participated in some form of a school meal program, whereas in Chile and the United States, more than two-thirds of their vulnerable student populations accessed a school meal. This highlights the importance and strong influence of national-level food policies on student nutrition and health, which Canada has yet to implement. In addition to school meal programs, national legislation is also required to address inappropriate marketing of unhealthy products, particularly those targeted at youth, alongside policies that dictate the provision of nutritious and sustainable meals in schools. A 2020 report by the World Health Organization, UNICEF, and Lancet Commission, Children in All Policies 2030, called for a new global initiative to put the health and well-being of children and adolescents at the center of global and national efforts to achieve sustainable development. Of relevance is 1 of the primary objectives of this initiative to protect children of all ages from the harmful impacts of food marketing, which is also reflected in the World Health Organization Set of Recommendations on the Marketing of Foods and Non-Alcoholic Beverages to Children and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. Governments have been repeatedly called upon to restrict unhealthy food and beverage marketing to children and adolescents because this marketing exploits their health and development. However, the only \u00e2\u0080\u009cguidelines\u00e2\u0080\u009d in Canada were implemented in 2007 (by the Canadian Children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative) and stipulated voluntary self-regulation of marketing practices by the food industry. The lack of legislation is largely due to industry stakeholders interacting with the government, such as the recent lobbying against a proposed bill in 2018 (Bill S-228). This is in exception to Quebec\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Consumer Protection Act (1980), which was the first legislation that does not permit commercial marketing to children younger than 13\u00e2\u0080\u0089years on all marketing media and channels. Despite no federal-level legislation addressing harmful marketing practices, there is clear acknowledgement of the need to improve affordability, accessibility, and advertisement of healthy foods and beverages. Marketing of branded and/or unhealthy food and beverage items, such as chocolate, pizza, and other fast foods, remains pervasive across the country. Adherence to marketing guidelines and policies implemented at the local level is also an area of concern. A study in British Columbia showed that 26% of promotions violated the Board of Education\u00e2\u0080\u0099s advertising policies and only 13% displayed appropriate nutritional messaging. This evidence further raises the issues of regulation, adherence, and compliance when there is absence of official governmental legislation. Although the Association of Canadian Advertisers, the Canadian Beverage Association and Food, Health & Consumer Products of Canada, and Restaurants Canada recently created the \u00e2\u0080\u009cFood and Beverage Advertising Code\u00e2\u0080\u009d to outline marketing conditions that advertisements catered to children are expected to comply with by summer 2023, this, too, is not legislation, and regulation remains unclear. The lack of federal and provincial (save Quebec) guidance and leadership has placed an onus on school boards, local governance, and other organizations to develop and implement their own policies for in-school advertising and programming and ensure these align with international guidelines. However, the effectiveness and compliance of these local actions are questionable. Our review found that school meal programs were offered at random and based on voluntary local or provincial implementation with no cohesive strategy or standards even within the same province. This is also reflected in the adoption of the HPS approach or its equivalent in Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario, and Nova Scotia. These programs were interpreted and contextualized based on each province to encourage enabling school food environments (eg, APPLE Schools, Healthy Buddies, AS! BC, ANHPSP, Battle River Project, Health Promoting Secondary Schools). To further demonstrate this sheer complexity, in Nova Scotia alone, a smaller province within the country, there were 70 provincial policies and 509 policies across 8 public school regions that were relevant to the HPS framework. This review illustrates that there are numerous policies and programs, with varying designs, implementation strategies, and mixed results in terms of their effectiveness on improved behaviors, diets, or nutrition, making meaningful comparison between programs or policies, and provinces and territories extremely challenging. Likewise, a multiregional survey using a representative sample of high school students from 7 provinces (n\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u008912\u00e2\u0080\u008a110) found that neither healthful nor nonhealthful eating behaviors differed significantly between schools with voluntary (OR, 0.83; 95%CI, 0.64, 1.08) and mandatory (OR, 1.16; 95%CI, 0.83, 1.64) nutrition policies. Ultimately, there is a patchwork of provincial and local actions that has developed over the years that govern and influence the Canadian school food environment. Given the vastness of the country and the diversity of populations, settings, and governance structures, schools have implemented a wide range of food environment and nutrition policies according to their individual missions and student needs, including direct provision, safeguards against marketing branded or highly processed foods and beverages, school meal standards, and nutrition education. Physical environment In addition to political factors, a key area of change and beneficial impact in the school food environment is improving the physical space through food availability and accessibility, and the physical infrastructure and capacity of schools to provide food and beverages. Across Canada, 7 provincial guidelines have been released on the nutritional profile of foods and beverages provided in schools, with many being updated since the release of the 2019 food guidelines for Canada. Although a recent and comprehensive school food environment assessment has yet to be conducted across Canada, Browning et al surveyed 436 primary and secondary schools in 2013 to understand food access within and around schools, as well as availability of healthy food options. Their findings suggest that although schools had access to a cafeteria, shop, or vending machine, the provision of healthy options was greatest in cafeterias (89.3% of schools) and lowest in vending machines (41.3%), and only 39.9% of schools had access to fruits and vegetables. Assessing food availability and accessibility beyond the supply and distribution of food to schools remains an important consideration, given school-based nutrition interventions strictly providing food provisions have had insignificant impacts on children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s home food environment, home fruit and/or vegetable availability, and parental modelling of fruit and/or vegetable consumption. The present review suggests that, with the exception of the provision of school snacks or meals, changes to the physical environment and their effect on outcomes of interest, like dietary intake and anthropometry, were limited in the published literature. Only 8 interventions explicitly mentioned implementing some form of an environmental change other than food provisions. This included improving existing infrastructure and equipment or constructing new infrastructure, such as school gardens. Other changes involved introducing school-wide bans of high-fat and high-sugar foods and restricting the sale of foods in vending machines and canteens to healthier snack and beverage options. However, the majority of these interventions and programs were implemented in conjunction with behavioral changes, such as nutrition education, whereas only 2 interventions altered the food environment alone. Interestingly, all the studies that altered the food environment indicated some improvement, either significant or insignificant, to overall nutritious food preferences, fruit and vegetable intake, fat and fiber intake, non-SSB intake, and anthropometric measures, such as obesity, waist circumference, body fat percentage, and BMI, when compared with baseline or groups who were not exposed to environmental changes. Similar to Colley et al, the majority of studies in this review used multicomponent interventions, consisting of both a behavioral component (eg, a nutrition education program) and an environmental component, defined as any policy or physical change to the environment (including infrastructure and resources). None of the studies disaggregated outcome data on the basis of the discrete behavioral and environmental components, limiting the ability to analyze and understand the environment-specific effects on nutrition outcomes in this age group. Single-component interventions mostly implemented behavioral components, such as nutritional education, that were incorporated into existing curriculum or peer-, family-, and/or community support. Notable high-quality evidence was identified in Ontario and Quebec, where changes to the curriculum resulted in improved fruit and vegetable intake by kindergarten and grade 5\u00e2\u0080\u00936 participants. In comparison, notable high-quality evidence of multicomponent interventions mostly was found in western Canada, where student\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dietary intake and BMI improved significantly after the implementation of nutrition education, food provisions, physical activity, and community-based initiatives in Alberta and British Columbia. Social environment Although schools varied in terms of their school food and nutrition initiatives and infrastructure, key barriers to the participation, acceptance, and sustainability of interventions, programs, and policies were attributed to social factors. The most common barrier was staff capacity, which led to inconsistencies in implementation and added stress on staff. Logistical challenges also prevented the availability, sourcing, and delivery of resources due to natural causes, financial constraints, and the loss of leadership and support. Although meaningfully intended, school food and NPs that are specifically geared toward students in need can contribute to stigma and social exclusion of students and families experiencing food insecurity or those of lower SES when it is made obvious who is receiving meals. This may influence participation and momentum. Needs-based programs in which students and families must identify that they are food insecure or have lower SES may be counterproductive because those in need may be too shy, embarrassed, or proud to sign up. Although this finding may suggest that a universal program, instead of a needs-based one, would increase uptake, evidence in the literature suggests this may not always be guaranteed. Godin et al reported a 16% student participation rate despite offering universal breakfast programs in Ontario and Alberta. Muthuswamy et al also showed that perception is a strong factor that can significantly influence participation among students. Some fears of stigma include fear of being labeled, judged, or laughed at; teased for using meal programs; or standing out among their peers of higher SES or those with greater food security. Some of this stigmatization could also be resolved with better communication between the school or programs and students and their families. Miscommunication or a lack of communication between parents/guardians and the school about the purpose of the programs, what the programs offer, and how they work led to decreased participation rate. This is a common theme reported in the literature. It is also important to consider how culture and ethnicity affect food choice and participation in these programs. Misalignment between nutrition recommendations and cultural preferences of participants and their parents can affect participation. This is seen in both Indigenous and non-Indigenous groups. This is similar to other evidence in both Canada and the United States showing that cultural appropriateness of food and cultural practices of students and their families can affect participation, regardless of need. Muthuswamy et al and Skinner et al recommend involving student input on food preferences and options in school cafeterias and meal or snack programs to improve acceptance and participation. On the other hand, a key element that helped program sustainability and policy implementation was community engagement and establishing strong relationships with the community. These relationships and networks served as a resource for valuable input and voluntary support. This was especially common among the Indigenous-specific studies included, which noted key factors for successful program implementation were the involvement of Indigenous Elders and Knowledge Keepers, and building relationships and communication between stakeholder groups throughout the design and implementation phases. In alignment with the aforementioned barriers, successful implementation was also found in programs that had adequate access to resources, funding, and consistent leadership. Key takeaways The first key takeaway from this review is that program evaluation is inconsistent and challenging across the country. Not only is existing research and evaluation of programs and policies disproportionate across the provinces and territories, they are also largely concentrated in certain areas, such British Columbia, Ontario, and Alberta, with limited research conducted in the Territories and among Indigenous student populations. Important to note, however, is that the evidence base is rapidly evolving. A 2021 analysis of school food programs in Canada highlighted that 100% of schools in the Northwest Territories and Nunavut and 94% of schools in Yukon have school food programs, with an 87% student participation rate. However, these programs, along with other community-based programming and initiatives, are not rigorously evaluated or documented, especially in Indigenous communities, and as such, may have been absent in our literature search. This may lead to gaps in research and records reviewing these programs and their effects, and a lack of generalizability of program evaluations, given limited comprehensive representation of the student populations across the country. The second key takeaway is that given the lack of federal-level policy or legislation that outlines standards and procedures, local and individualized development of programs and policies reflects immense heterogeneity in demographics, geography, and scale (ie, local or provincial/territorial), which contributes to differences in design, methodology, and implementation. These include infrastructural indicators (eg, presence of lunch programs, types of food and beverages offered in school cafeterias); KAP of school administration, teaching staff, and students; anthropometry; dietary intake; physical activity; health practices; educational gains; and academic performance. Some programs chose one or all of these measures in their design and evaluations. Given the different student populations by province or territory, cultural and ethnic groups, and urban and rural settings, it is expected that programs differ by design and implementation to best address the needs and community reflected in particular settings. Programs may also differ in their duration, which adds further complexity to the ability to evaluate effectiveness. For example, even when schools adopted the HPS framework in the design phase, the selection of core HPS components to be included were not necessarily standardized or uniformly implemented, with each school interpreting and contextualizing the framework to fit their needs and criteria. This makes it difficult to compare and contrast programs, even those under the same framework, because current programs are often administered voluntarily and operated at the discretion of individual school capacities. The third key takeaway is that this review highlights the strong dependency of current research on latent construct indicators such as KAP, with few using observable biophysical indicators, such as micronutrient deficiencies and anthropometry. The most commonly reported effectiveness outcomes were dietary intake and KAP measured through quantitative surveys or qualitative interviews, which, in both cases, relied on self-reporting. Although KAP can capture key information about student acquisition of knowledge or changes in attitudes and perspectives after an educational-based intervention, there are limitations to its use. First, KAP surveys can be difficult to interpret without a benchmark or standard reference to classify KAP among the study participants. This standard reference might be achieved by comparison with a similar KAP survey conducted in a similar population with similar methods; however, realistically, this is not always possible, especially among the variable school food programs and policies that are evaluated across the country. In addition, we found in through review that health knowledge did not necessarily translate into sustained behavior changes. Significant improvements in student knowledge among participants exposed to health literacy programming concerning Canada\u00e2\u0080\u0099s food guidelines did not translate into significant changes in food behaviors, such as vegetable intake. Even when positive food behavior changes were identified immediately after assessment, these short-term impacts were often short-lived after follow-up assessments, ranging from 2\u00e2\u0080\u0089months to 7\u00e2\u0080\u0089years, showed insignificant changes in programs across the country. Most importantly, healthy eating is a much more complicated concept beyond acquiring adequate literacy to guide individual decision-making. Conducting holistic and intersectional investigations should require careful examinations of obesogenic environments, geographic location, family income, and other ecological determinants. Strengths and limitations Overall, this review is strengthened by the breadth and depth of the literature examined using systematic methods and evolving evidence that corroborates our findings. The wide heterogeneity and low quality of experimental study designs (ie, single or multicomponent interventions, duration, randomization, outcomes assessed) did not allow for a formal meta-analysis. Given this, all relevant studies, regardless of quality and RoB, were included in this narrative review. As well, physical activity\u00e2\u0080\u0093focused programs and policies that did not have an explicit food and nutrition component were not included in this review. This may have excluded studies and evaluations that may have had an indirect impact on children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s overall nutrition and dietary behaviors. Measurement tools used in observational study designs were also highly variable and often study-specific. High-quality measurement methods are required to conduct assessments and evaluations of the school food environment to not only offer comparable data but also to better inform future policies and practices that can lead to improved diets and nutritional status.",
    "CONCL": "CONCLUSION Canada remains the only Group of Seven country without a national school meal program, with 1 in every 20 students in Canada missing lunch on a given school day. In 2021, Canada\u00e2\u0080\u0099s federal government committed to developing a national school food policy. However, beyond this, multidisciplinary and concerted efforts across the provinces and territories at both the local and provincial/territorial levels are needed to address the multiple threats to food and nutrition security our children and adolescents face. We found that the Canadian school-based food environment literature remains largely heterogeneous and is primarily focused on nutrition education and physical activity programs that use self-reported data that are measured through quantitative and or qualitative methods to infer changes in children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nutrition. A minority of literature evaluates programs and policies connected with equity-seeking groups, despite these populations being closely associated with food insecurity. Few evaluated no-cost food provision programs, which could be owing to researcher preference or that, unfortunately, only 5% of students in Canada are covered by a school food program. This is a key area that the incoming national school food policy and future research and evaluations must address. The recent COVID-19 pandemic and current increasing inflation and food costs have exposed and possibly exacerbated already existing inequities in food systems and food environments. Even prior to the pandemic, the evidence was clear that Indigenous communities and marginalized and racialized populations are especially vulnerable to food insecurity and are unable to meet the recommendations of Canada\u00e2\u0080\u0099s food guidelines. Schools are a critical entry point to shaping nutrition-promoting behaviors, and this review provides much-needed evidence on school food and nutrition interventions, programs, and policies in Canada. We report in this review rich evidence on key facilitators and barriers to implementation and sustainability of programs provided by stakeholders, while also uncovering important evidence gaps that require careful examination for future evaluations. National, provincial, and local governments should design multisectoral policies and programs with equity in mind to ensure vulnerable and marginalized groups can access or achieve a sufficient, diverse, nutritious diet that is culturally appropriate and aligns with Canada's food guidelines and jurisdictional nutrition standards. Importantly, in consultation with local communities, programs must be tailored to context and cuisine to ensure maximal acceptance and engagement.",

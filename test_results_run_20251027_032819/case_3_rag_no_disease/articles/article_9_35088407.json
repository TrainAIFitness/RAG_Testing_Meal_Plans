  "abstract": "Abstract Background Debates on effective and safe diets for managing obesity in adults are ongoing. Low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets (also known as 'low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carb diets') continue to be widely promoted, marketed and commercialised as being more effective for weight loss, and healthier, than 'balanced'\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets. Objectives To compare the effects of low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets to weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets with balanced ranges of carbohydrates, in relation to changes in weight and cardiovascular risk, in overweight and obese adults without and with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Search methods We searched MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase (Ovid), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Web of Science Core Collection (Clarivate Analytics), ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) up to 25 June 2021, and screened reference lists of included trials and relevant systematic reviews.\u00c2\u00a0Language or publication restrictions were not applied. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in adults (18 years+) who were overweight or living with obesity, without or with T2DM, and without or with cardiovascular conditions or risk factors. Trials had to compare low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets to balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate (45% to 65% of total energy (TE)) weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets, have a weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phase of 2 weeks or longer and be explicitly implemented for the primary purpose of reducing weight, with or without advice to restrict energy intake.\u00c2 Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts and full\u00e2\u0080\u0090text articles to determine eligibility; and independently extracted data, assessed risk of bias using RoB 2\u00c2\u00a0and assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. We stratified analyses by participants without and with T2DM, and by diets with weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phases only and those with weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phases followed by weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phases. Primary outcomes were change in body weight (kg) and the number of participants per group with weight loss of at least 5%, assessed at short\u00e2\u0080\u0090 (three months to < 12 months) and long\u00e2\u0080\u0090term (\u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months) follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up. Main results We included 61 parallel\u00e2\u0080\u0090arm RCTs that randomised 6925 participants to either low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate or balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets. All trials\u00c2\u00a0were conducted in high\u00e2\u0080\u0090income countries except for one\u00c2\u00a0in China. Most participants (n = 5118 randomised) did not have T2DM. Mean baseline weight across trials was 95 kg (range 66 to 132 kg). Participants with T2DM were older (mean 57 years, range 50 to 65) than those without T2DM (mean 45 years, range 22 to 62). Most trials included men and women (42/61; 3/19 men only; 16/19 women only), and people without baseline cardiovascular conditions, risk factors or events (36/61). Mean baseline diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and low\u00e2\u0080\u0090density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol across trials were within normal ranges. The longest weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phase of diets was two years in participants without and with T2DM. Evidence from studies with weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phases followed by weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phases was limited. Most trials investigated low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets (> 50 g to 150 g per day or < 45% of TE; n = 42), followed by very low (\u00e2\u0089\u00a4 50 g per day or < 10% of TE; n = 14), and then incremental increases from very low to low (n = 5). The most common diets compared were low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate, balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090fat (20 to 35% of TE) and high\u00e2\u0080\u0090protein (> 20% of TE) treatment diets versus control diets balanced\u00c2\u00a0for the three macronutrients (24/61). In most trials (45/61) the energy prescription or approach used to restrict energy intake was similar in both groups. We assessed the overall risk of bias of outcomes across trials as predominantly high, mostly from bias due to missing outcome data. Using GRADE, we assessed the certainty of evidence as moderate to very low across outcomes.\u00c2 Participants without and with T2DM lost weight when following weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phases of both diets at the short (range: 12.2 to 0.33 kg) and long term (range: 13.1 to 1.7 kg).\u00c2 In overweight and obese participants without T2DM: low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets compared to balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets (weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phases only) probably result in little to no difference in change in body weight over three to 8.5 months (mean difference (MD) \u00e2\u0088\u00921.07 kg, (95% confidence interval (CI) \u00e2\u0088\u00921.55 to \u00e2\u0088\u00920.59, I2 = 51%, 3286 participants, 37 RCTs,\u00c2\u00a0moderate\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence) and over one to two years (MD \u00e2\u0088\u00920.93 kg, 95% CI \u00e2\u0088\u00921.81 to \u00e2\u0088\u00920.04, I2 = 40%, 1805 participants, 14 RCTs,\u00c2\u00a0moderate\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence); as well as change in DBP and LDL cholesterol over one to two years. The evidence is very uncertain about whether there is a difference in the number of participants per group with weight loss of at least 5% at one year (risk ratio (RR) 1.11, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.31, I2 = 17%, 137 participants, 2 RCTs,\u00c2\u00a0very low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence).\u00c2 In overweight and obese participants with T2DM: low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets compared to balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets (weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phases only) probably result in little to no difference in change in body weight over three to six months (MD \u00e2\u0088\u00921.26 kg, 95% CI \u00e2\u0088\u00922.44 to \u00e2\u0088\u00920.09, I2\u00c2\u00a0= 47%, 1114 participants, 14 RCTs,\u00c2\u00a0moderate\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence) and over one to two years (MD \u00e2\u0088\u00920.33 kg, 95% CI \u00e2\u0088\u00922.13 to 1.46, I2\u00c2\u00a0= 10%, 813 participants, 7 RCTs,\u00c2\u00a0moderate\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence); as well in change in DBP, HbA1c and LDL cholesterol over 1 to 2 years.

What are low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate and balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets? People spend lots of money on trying to lose weight using diets, products, foods and books, and continue to debate about which diets are effective and safe. So, examining the scientific evidence behind claims made is important. Low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets are a broad category of weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets that manipulate and restrict carbohydrates, protein and fat in diets. There are no consistent, widely\u00e2\u0080\u0090accepted definitions of these diets and different descriptions are used (such as, 'low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate, high\u00e2\u0080\u0090protein\u00e2\u0080\u0099, 'low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate, high\u00e2\u0080\u0090fat', or \u00e2\u0080\u0098very low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate\u00e2\u0080\u0099). Low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets are implemented in different ways, but they restrict grains, cereals and legumes, and other carbohydrate\u00e2\u0080\u0090containing foods; such as dairy, most fruit and certain vegetables. These foods are then typically replaced with foods higher in fat and protein; such as meats, eggs, cheese, butter, cream, oils. Some low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets recommend eating as desired, while others recommend restricting the amount of energy eaten.\u00c2 Balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets contain more moderate amounts of carbohydrates, protein and fats, in line with current healthy eating advice from health authorities. When used for weight reduction, balanced diets recommend restricting the amount of energy eaten by guiding people to reduce their portion sizes and choose healthier foods (e.g. lean instead of fatty meat). Low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets are widely promoted, marketed and commercialised as being more effective for weight loss, and healthier, than 'balanced'\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets. What did we want to find out? We wanted to find out if low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets were better for weight loss and heart disease risk factors than balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets in adults who were overweight or living with obesity. We wanted to find this out for people with and without type 2 diabetes. What did we do?\u00e2\u0080\u00a8We searched six electronic databases and trial registries for all trials* that compared low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets with balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets in adults who were overweight or living with obesity. The trials had to last for at least three months. We compared and summarised the results of the trials and rated our confidence in the combined evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.\u00c2 *A trial is a type of study in which participants are assigned randomly to two or more treatment groups. This is the best way to ensure similar groups of participants. What did we find? We found 61 trials involving 6925 people who were overweight or living with obesity. The biggest trial was in 419 people and the smallest was in 20 people. All except one of the trials were conducted in high\u00e2\u0080\u0090income countries worldwide, and nearly half were undertaken in the USA (26). Most trials (36) were undertaken in people who did not have heart disease or risk factors. Most people (5118 people) did not have type 2 diabetes. The average starting weight of people across the trials was 95 kg. Most studies (37) lasted for six months or less; and the longest studies (6) lasted for two years. Main results Low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets probably result in little to no difference in weight loss over the short term (trials lasting 3 to 8.5 months) and long term (trials lasting one to two years) compared to balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets, in people with and without type 2 diabetes. In the short term, the average difference in weight loss was about 1 kg and in the long term, the average difference was less than 1 kg.\u00c2 People lost weight on both diets in some trials. The amount of weight lost on average varied greatly with both diets across the trials from less than 1 kg in some trials and up to about 12 kg in others in the short term and long term.\u00c2 Similarly, low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets probably result in little to no difference in diastolic blood pressure, glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and LDL cholesterol (\u00e2\u0080\u0098unhealthy\u00e2\u0080\u0099 cholesterol) for up to two years.\u00c2 We could not draw any conclusions about unwanted effects reported by participants because very few trials reported these. What are the limitations of the evidence?\u00c2 We are moderately confident in the evidence.

The most common diets compared were low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate, balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090fat (20 to 35% of TE) and high\u00e2\u0080\u0090protein (> 20% of TE) treatment diets versus control diets balanced\u00c2\u00a0for the three macronutrients (24/61). In most trials (45/61) the energy prescription or approach used to restrict energy intake was similar in both groups. We assessed the overall risk of bias of outcomes across trials as predominantly high, mostly from bias due to missing outcome data. Using GRADE, we assessed the certainty of evidence as moderate to very low across outcomes.\u00c2 Abstract: We included 61 parallel\u00e2\u0080\u0090arm RCTs that randomised 6925 participants to either low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate or balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets. All trials\u00c2\u00a0were conducted in high\u00e2\u0080\u0090income countries except for one\u00c2\u00a0in China. Most participants (n = 5118 randomised) did not have T2DM. Mean baseline weight across trials was 95 kg (range 66 to 132 kg). Participants with T2DM were older (mean 57 years, range 50 to 65) than those without T2DM (mean 45 years, range 22 to 62). Most trials included men and women (42/61; 3/19 men only; 16/19 women only), and people without baseline cardiovascular conditions, risk factors or events (36/61). Mean baseline diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and low\u00e2\u0080\u0090density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol across trials were within normal ranges. The longest weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phase of diets was two years in participants without and with T2DM. Evidence from studies with weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phases followed by weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phases was limited. Abstract: Main results Abstract: Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts and full\u00e2\u0080\u0090text articles to determine eligibility; and independently extracted data, assessed risk of bias using RoB 2\u00c2\u00a0and assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. We stratified analyses by participants without and with T2DM, and by diets with weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phases only and those with weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phases followed by weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phases. Primary outcomes were change in body weight (kg) and the number of participants per group with weight loss of at least 5%, assessed at short\u00e2\u0080\u0090 (three months to < 12 months) and long\u00e2\u0080\u0090term (\u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months) follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up. Abstract: Data collection and analysis Abstract: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in adults (18 years+) who were overweight or living with obesity, without or with T2DM, and without or with cardiovascular conditions or risk factors. Trials had to compare low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets to balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate (45% to 65% of total energy (TE)) weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets, have a weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phase of 2 weeks or longer and be explicitly implemented for the primary purpose of reducing weight, with or without advice to restrict energy intake.\u00c2 Abstract: Selection criteria Abstract: We searched MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase (Ovid), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Web of Science Core Collection (Clarivate Analytics), ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) up to 25 June 2021, and screened reference lists of included trials and relevant systematic reviews.\u00c2\u00a0Language or publication restrictions were not applied.

Abstract: Objectives Abstract: Debates on effective and safe diets for managing obesity in adults are ongoing. Low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets (also known as 'low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carb diets') continue to be widely promoted, marketed and commercialised as being more effective for weight loss, and healthier, than 'balanced'\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets.

For the first time in history, more people globally are dying from the consequences of overeating than starvation and malnutrition (Forouzanfar 2015). This shift has happened in the last 20 to 30 years and is thought to be mainly due to diets that are of poor nutritional quality, high in energy density and often ultra\u00e2\u0080\u0090processed. Such diets often result in cumulative weight gain over time and consequently increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, stroke and some cancers (Forouzanfar 2015). Globalised food systems promote over\u00e2\u0080\u0090consumption of these foods (Moubarac 2014;\u00c2\u00a0Swinburn 2011). INTRO: High body mass index (BMI) is an important modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, kidney diseases, certain cancers and musculoskeletal conditions (Berrington 2010;\u00c2\u00a0ERFC 2011;\u00c2\u00a0GBMRF for CD Collaboration 2014;\u00c2\u00a0Singh 2013;\u00c2\u00a0Whitlock 2009;\u00c2\u00a0Zheng 2011). The disease burdens related to obesity are particularly evident in low\u00e2\u0080\u0090 and middle\u00e2\u0080\u0090income countries. Cardiovascular disease deaths rose by 12.5% from 15.9 million in 2005 to 17.9 million in 2015, and low\u00e2\u0080\u0090 and middle\u00e2\u0080\u0090income countries accounted for over three\u00e2\u0080\u0090quarters of these deaths (GBD MCDC 2016). In Africa, between 1980 and 2014, age\u00e2\u0080\u0090standardised prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) increased from 4.8% to 9.7% in men and from 7.7% to 12.6% in women (NCD\u00e2\u0080\u0090RisC 2017). These shifting disease patterns have a major impact on individual and family well\u00e2\u0080\u0090being, and on economies, with large direct and indirect costs being associated with illness. INTRO: Description of the intervention INTRO: Pharmacotherapy, bariatric surgery and counselling that target diet, physical activity, and behaviour change are used to treat adult obesity (Dietz 2015). Due to the chronic and relapsing nature of obesity and its related conditions, current guidelines for the treatment of obesity recommend comprehensive management approaches that aim to achieve long\u00e2\u0080\u0090term weight reduction. This includes intensive lifestyle intervention characterised by dietary restriction, increased physical activity, and behavioural management as first\u00e2\u0080\u0090line treatment (Dietz 2015;\u00c2\u00a0Jensen 2014). Importantly, there is no 'one\u00e2\u0080\u0090size\u00e2\u0080\u0090fits\u00e2\u0080\u0090all' weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diet and different diets work for different people, based on preferences and ease of adherence (Jensen 2014;\u00c2\u00a0Johnston 2014). INTRO: The public, families and health professionals face an often dizzying array of weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets, many of which have been commercialised as books, seminars, diet food products, supplements and other related products. These include, but are not limited to, various versions of low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets (for example, Atkins diet (Atkins 1999)), low\u00e2\u0080\u0090fat or so\u00e2\u0080\u0090called 'balanced diets', very low\u00e2\u0080\u0090fat diets (for example, Ornish diet (Ornish 2001)), and low\u00e2\u0080\u0090glycaemic diets (for example, South Beach diet (Agatston 2003)). INTRO: Nutrients are needed by the body in small (i.e. micronutrients such as vitamins and minerals) or large amounts (i.e. macronutrients) for growth, repair and optimal functioning (Lichtenstein 2005). Total daily energy intake is made up of the sum of the energy provided by the three macronutrients (i.e. carbohydrate, protein and fat). Per gram of macronutrient, carbohydrates and protein each provides about 17 kilojoules (approximately 4 kilocalories), while fat provides about 37 kilojoules (approximately 9 kilocalories) (Carreiro 2016). Carbohydrates are primarily contained in grains, cereals and sugar, and in the digestive tract are broken down into glucose. Carbohydrates are the largest nutrient class, and traditionally, the greatest energy source. If energy intake exceeds energy requirements, excess carbohydrates will be mainly stored in the liver as glycogen for later use or be converted to fatty acids when glycogen stores are saturated. In contrast, if the diet contains limited amounts of carbohydrate, the liver converts fat into fatty acids and ketones to replace glucose as an energy source (Paoli 2013). INTRO: Low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets are a broad category of weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets and programmes that manipulate and restrict macronutrient (carbohydrate, protein, fat) intake (Astrup 2004;\u00c2\u00a0Bazzano 2012;\u00c2\u00a0Campbell 2012;\u00c2\u00a0Hession 2009). There are no consistent and widely accepted definitions of these diets and different descriptions are used, such as 'low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate, high\u00e2\u0080\u0090protein' or 'low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate, high\u00e2\u0080\u0090fat', depending on the macronutrient manipulation and focus. In practice, low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets are applied in different ways, but generally restrict grains, cereals and legumes, and other foods that contain carbohydrates, such as dairy, most fruit and certain vegetables. The energy required is then typically replaced with food higher in fat and protein, such as meats, eggs, cheese, butter, cream and oils \u00e2\u0080\u0090 many of which are animal source foods. Some low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets recommend eating as desired, while others apply restrictions to total energy intake (Atkins 2011;\u00c2\u00a0Campbell 2012). INTRO: Conventional authorities such as the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA 2017), American Institute of Medicine Food and Nutrition Board (IOM 2005), Australian National Health and Medical Research Council together with the New Zealand Ministry of Health (NHMRC 2006), and the Nordic Council of Ministers, Nordic Committee of Senior Officials for Food Issues (NNR 2012), as well as the UK's Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN 2015), have recommended 45% to 65% of total energy as the appropriate carbohydrate intake for adults. Thus, some people regard low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets to be those with carbohydrate intakes below 45% of total energy. Some published definitions of low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets disregard the official recommendations, and use an upper limit of 40% of total energy from carbohydrates as indicative of a low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diet (Frigolet 2011;\u00c2\u00a0Wylie\u00e2\u0080\u0090Rosett 2013). In absolute, rather than proportional terms, low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets have been defined as having less than 200 g of carbohydrate (Frigolet 2011), while some disagree with this liberal definition, preferring to distinguish between 'non\u00e2\u0080\u0090ketogenic low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets' as containing 50 g to 150 g of carbohydrates, and 'ketogenic low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets' (or very low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets) as having a maximum of 50 g of carbohydrates, with this latter variant seen by some as being more effective for weight loss (Westman 2007;\u00c2\u00a0Yancy 2004). Ketogenic diets are characterised by a high production of ketones in the liver as an alternative energy source, as well as high levels of ketones in the blood (ketonaemia) and urine (ketonuria) when fat or protein intake is very high and carbohydrate intake is very low (less than 50 g/day) (Paoli 2013). INTRO: Weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets aligned with current dietary recommendations are often referred to as 'low\u00e2\u0080\u0090fat diets' or 'balanced, weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets', and will be referred to as 'balanced diets' in this review (British Dietetic Association 2013). Globally, current dietary recommendations \u00e2\u0080\u0090 in terms of macronutrients, micronutrients, food choices and dietary patterns \u00e2\u0080\u0090 are generally consistent, and governmental bodies from Europe, the USA, Australia and Nordic countries recommend that 45% to 65% of total energy intake should be provided by carbohydrates, between 10% and 35% by protein and between 20% and 35% by fat (EFSA 2017;\u00c2\u00a0IOM 2005;\u00c2\u00a0NHMRC 2006;\u00c2\u00a0NNR 2012). There is room for flexibility within these ranges from lower to higher intakes of carbohydrate, fat and protein. These dietary recommendations are accompanied by information on 'better food' choices; improving the quality of carbohydrates (e.g. whole grains versus refined grains), protein (e.g. fish versus processed meat) and fat (e.g. olive oil versus butter); as well as on maintaining a healthy body weight by aiming to keep energy intake and energy expenditure balanced. INTRO: Nutrition recommendations are moving away from macronutrient\u00e2\u0080\u0090focused, single food and single nutrient messages towards recommendations about dietary patterns and \u00e2\u0080\u0098total diets\u00e2\u0080\u0099 (NICE 2014;\u00c2\u00a0NNR 2012;\u00c2\u00a0USDA 2014). This has been driven mainly by the lack of clear and consistent associations between individual nutrients (micronutrients and macronutrients) and disease risk, limitations of single nutrient trials, and greater successes of 'total diet' or dietary pattern interventions. INTRO: Dietary patterns can be defined as \"the quantities, proportions, variety, or combination of different foods, drinks, and nutrients (when available) in diets, and the frequency with which they are habitually consumed\" (USDA 2014). Current evidence supports associations between some dietary patterns and lower risk of obesity and chronic diseases, especially T2DM, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and certain cancers (DGAC 2015;\u00c2\u00a0USDA 2014). For example, systematic reviews of large long\u00e2\u0080\u0090term studies show that several dietary patterns are consistently and equally associated with a lower risk of developing T2DM\u00c2\u00a0in the future (Alhazmi 2014;\u00c2\u00a0Esposito 2014;\u00c2\u00a0Koloverou 2014). These dietary patterns have different macronutrient compositions, but share several common components, including fruit, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, healthy oils, adequate proteins (such as seafood and lean meat), reduced intake of red and processed meats and sugar\u00e2\u0080\u0090sweetened beverages, and little or moderate alcohol (Ndanuko 2016;\u00c2\u00a0NNR 2012;\u00c2\u00a0USDA 2014). It has been suggested that carbohydrate avoidance and the resultant food restrictions typical of low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets make it difficult to achieve a dietary pattern that is nutrient\u00e2\u0080\u0090 and fibre\u00e2\u0080\u0090rich, diverse, and that promotes good health (USDA 2014). INTRO: How the intervention might work INTRO: Energy balance and body\u00e2\u0080\u0090weight regulation is complex and interactive, and questions on certain components of energy balance and their interactions \u00e2\u0080\u0090 especially over the longer term \u00e2\u0080\u0090 are yet to be answered (Hall 2012). The first law of thermodynamics and evidence from various types of studies over the past 50 years, including randomised controlled trials (RCTs), support the view that weight loss occurs when the amount of kilojoules consumed during eating and drinking is less than the amount of kilojoules expended over weeks or months (ACC/AHA 2013 Full Report;\u00c2\u00a0Hall 2011;\u00c2\u00a0Hall 2012;\u00c2\u00a0Hall 2015;\u00c2\u00a0Jensen 2014). Thus, a plausible mechanism whereby low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets enable weight loss is by achieving a sustained energy deficit over time even when advice to explicitly restrict energy intake is not provided. When people eliminate and restrict carbohydrate\u00e2\u0080\u0090rich foods, they are more likely to reduce energy intake because they eat less food (Brehm 2003;\u00c2\u00a0Sondike 2003). Related mechanisms reported in the literature include a reduction in appetite with low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets, possibly related to the increased intake of fat and production of ketones (Boden 2005;\u00c2\u00a0Nordmann 2006;\u00c2\u00a0Westman 2007). Since total energy intake is known to drive changes in body weight, its role must be considered when examining the effect on any diet on weight changes. INTRO: Some literature indicates that certain macronutrients may have metabolic advantages over others, more specifically that lower carbohydrate intake is more effective for weight loss, independent of energy intake (Atkins 2011;\u00c2\u00a0Westman 2007). However, it has been proposed that when proportions of macronutrients in the diet are changed, rapid physiological adaptations occur that aim to match metabolic fuel selection to the diet. Changes in body composition and energy expenditure may be minimised by these adaptations. In this scenario, in the shorter term, all reduced energy diets would have a similar effect on loss of body fat (Hall 2011;\u00c2\u00a0Noakes 2006;\u00c2\u00a0Tay 2008). INTRO: Literature on low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets also suggest that the reduced insulin secretion resulting from a low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diet causes greater release of adipose tissue free fatty acids, fat oxidation and energy expenditure, and increased loss of body fat compared to restricting fat intake (Ludwig 2014;\u00c2\u00a0Taubes 2007;\u00c2\u00a0Westman 2007). However, a study in 19 obese adults confined to a metabolic ward demonstrated that an equal kilojoule\u00e2\u0080\u0090selective reduction in dietary fat resulted in no changes in insulin secretion, fat oxidation or energy expenditure and a greater net fat loss when compared to restricting carbohydrates by the same amount, which resulted in decreased insulin secretion, increased fat oxidation and decreased energy expenditure (Hall 2015). INTRO: According to recent clinical guidelines for obesity, a high\u00e2\u0080\u0090quality systematic review, a scientific report to inform dietary guidelines and a recent six\u00e2\u0080\u0090month randomised controlled feeding trial, a number of different diets may lead to weight loss over the short term if they achieve a sustained energy deficit, but some of these diets may be more advantageous than others for maintaining longer\u00e2\u0080\u0090term cardiovascular and metabolic health (DGAC 2015;\u00c2\u00a0Jensen 2014;\u00c2\u00a0Johnston 2014;\u00c2\u00a0Wan 2017). There is evidence that weight loss of 5% and more, or BMI reduction of at least 5%, may result in clinically meaningful improvements in cardio metabolic health following dietary regimens (Brown 2016;\u00c2\u00a0Truby 2006;\u00c2\u00a0Wald 2012;\u00c2\u00a0Wing 2010). INTRO: Adherence and weight maintenance INTRO: Poor dietary adherence has been regarded as one of the reasons popular and traditional dieting strategies are unsuccessful, and it is well known that adherence to nutrition counselling by study participants varies widely. Evidence from quality RCTs, systematic reviews and other study designs suggest that adherence to diets is a primary driver of weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090loss success, regardless of the macronutrient composition, and may explain a considerable part of whether dieters are able to achieve energy deficit for weight loss (Alhassan 2008;\u00c2\u00a0Dansinger 2005;\u00c2\u00a0Hall 2011;\u00c2\u00a0Johnston 2014;\u00c2\u00a0Sacks 2009). Dietary intake is difficult to measure accurately, and fidelity of application of dietary assessment methods varies widely across studies (Shim 2014), which may introduce a lot of variation into the assessment of adherence. Consequently, data on adherence to assigned diets are often lacking in weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090loss trials. Also, keeping the weight off once lost is also a considerable challenge in treating obesity, with most people tending to relapse (Dietz 2015). Indeed, a systematic review including 56 RCTs reported that dieting to lose weight is most often over weeks, months or years, and it is challenging for most people to maintain the weight lost over the long term (Collins 2013). Thus, ease of adherence to weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets is a key factor to consider. It is also necessary to consider the time\u00e2\u0080\u0090dependant nature of the relationship between diet and weight change when examining the effect of diets on weight change. Trials typically have different periods of follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up, and different frequencies or intervals of study contacts and measurement.\u00c2\u00a0Tay 2015\u00c2\u00a0indicated that changes sustained over a 12\u00e2\u0080\u0090month period reflects durability of effects over the long term. INTRO: Why it is important to do this review INTRO: The public spends considerable amounts of money and time on trying to diet, on books about diet, and on products and foods to enhance weight loss. It is therefore important to examine scientific evidence behind the claims made. INTRO: Some advocates claim low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets decrease cardiovascular disease and diabetes risk profiles: reducing triglycerides, increasing high\u00e2\u0080\u0090density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and improving glycaemic control over one year (Stern 2004); improving triglycerides, HDL cholesterol and glycaemic control over four years (Wing 2010); and improving aortic stiffness over four weeks (Syed\u00e2\u0080\u0090Abdul 2018). However, the diets are not without potential side effects. These include gastrointestinal disturbances, such as constipation, flatulence, indigestion or diarrhoea over the short term (Bhardwaj 2017;\u00c2\u00a0Brinkworth 2009a;\u00c2\u00a0Saslow 2014); and increasing low\u00e2\u0080\u0090density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and non\u00e2\u0080\u0090HDL cholesterol over 12 months (Brinkworth 2009b;\u00c2\u00a0Wan 2017). Some participants report mood disturbance and impaired ability to concentrate (Brinkworth 2009c;\u00c2\u00a0Halyburton 2007). Other side effects of low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets include lack of appetite, bad breath, headaches, muscle cramps, general weakness and hair loss (Foster 2010;\u00c2\u00a0Rio 2001;\u00c2\u00a0Yancy 2004). INTRO: A prospective cohort study and meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis that combined 25\u00e2\u0080\u0090year follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Community (ARIC) data (USA) and seven other cohort studies (USA, Europe, Asia and multinational) assessed the association between carbohydrate intake and mortality (Seidelmann 2018). Findings indicated that both high\u00e2\u0080\u0090 and low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets increased mortality, with the lowest risk observed among those who consumed a diet containing 50% to 55% carbohydrates. The low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate dietary patterns that favoured animal fat and protein sources were associated with higher mortality, while those that favoured plant\u00e2\u0080\u0090based foods were associated with lower mortality. Additionally, diets very high in animal source foods could pose a significant threat to environmental sustainability (Sabate 2014;\u00c2\u00a0Soret 2014). INTRO: The debate on effective and safe diets for treating obesity continues. Many trials and systematic reviews involving obese people (with and without comorbidities), of varying methodological quality, have assessed the effects of low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets on weight and other risk factors. \u00c2\u00a0A number of these studies show little or no clinically important difference in weight loss of up to two years' follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up (Chawla 2020;\u00c2\u00a0Dong 2020;\u00c2\u00a0Van Zuuren 2018). A systematic review of eight RCTs found that improvements in psychosocial outcomes occur in participants on short\u00e2\u0080\u0090 and longer\u00e2\u0080\u0090term weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090loss programmes, regardless of the macronutrient composition of the diet (Ghoch 2016). However, low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets continue to be widely promoted, marketed and commercialised as being more effective for weight loss, and healthier, than weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets that have 'balanced' or macronutrient compositions in line with current global dietary recommendations. Healthcare officials argue that very restrictive carbohydrate diets do not promote behaviour changes that foster varied, nutrient\u00e2\u0080\u0090 and fibre\u00e2\u0080\u0090rich dietary patterns (USDA 2014), known to reduce risks of cardiovascular disease, hypertension, T2DM\u00c2\u00a0and certain cancers. Extreme restriction or excess of macronutrients, as advised with very low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets, instead promote a way of eating that is likely to result in an imbalance of macronutrient intake, suboptimal micronutrient intake and increased disease risk over time. INTRO: Previously, we took stock of existing systematic reviews on low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets for adults wanting to lose weight. We found 50 existing reviews (last search date: 3 March 2014), with a number of shortcomings as reported in\u00c2\u00a0Naude 2014. This exercise helped inform the protocol for our earlier systematic review and meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis of RCTs (Naude 2014). This Cochrane Review will be a fresh edition to\u00c2\u00a0Naude 2014, by taking into account new eligible trials, and comments and criticisms generated by the earlier work. INTRO: Objectives INTRO: To compare the effects of low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets to weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets with balanced ranges of carbohydrates, in relation to changes in weight and cardiovascular risk, in overweight and obese adults without T2DM\u00c2\u00a0(comparisons 1 and 2) and with T2DM\u00c2\u00a0(comparisons 3 and 4) METHODS: Methods METHODS: Criteria for considering studies for this review METHODS: Types of studies METHODS: As per our protocol (Naude 2019), we included parallel\u00e2\u0080\u0090arm individual\u00e2\u0080\u0090 and cluster\u00e2\u0080\u0090randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that had an active weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing intervention phase of at least 12 weeks. According to\u00c2\u00a0Jensen 2014, obese individuals on a moderately restricted energy intake can potentially lose between six and eight kilograms, or five to ten per cent of initial body weight (clinically meaningful) over a six\u00e2\u0080\u0090month period. From this, we inferred that it would be plausible to lose five per cent of initial weight over a three\u00e2\u0080\u0090month period. According to the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), 12 weeks is the standard length for most commissioned dietary interventions (Ahern 2017;\u00c2\u00a0NICE 2014). Follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up of participants after the intervention ended could be of any duration. METHODS: We excluded quasi\u00e2\u0080\u0090randomised trials (that is, trials that used an inadequate method of randomisation, such as alternation or date of birth). We included cross\u00e2\u0080\u0090over trials where the first phase was 12 weeks or longer, and where data for the first phase per group were available. We excluded cross\u00e2\u0080\u0090over trials not meeting these criteria due to the possible period and carry\u00e2\u0080\u0090over effects that would arise with the eligible dietary interventions, condition (overweight and obesity) and outcomes in this review, with these not being easily reversible as required for a valid cross\u00e2\u0080\u0090over design (Younge 2015). METHODS: We only included studies with a weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phase if the preceding weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phase was for 12 weeks or longer, and relevant data from this phase were available. We separated analyses for weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing and weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phases. METHODS: Types of participants METHODS: We included adults (18 years and older) who were overweight or living with obesity (as defined by trial authors), with or without T2DM, and with or without cardiovascular conditions or risk factors such as hypertension or dyslipidaemia (as defined by trial authors). METHODS: We excluded studies where pregnant and lactating women were included, as well as studies in people with specific medical conditions such as bipolar disorder, polycystic ovary syndrome, chronic renal disease, and so on. METHODS: We included studies involving a subset of eligible participants (for example, adults and children, as defined by trial authors) if results were reported separately for the eligible subset (for example, those \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 18 years). If not, we only included such studies if 80% or more of the baseline sample were eligible for our review (for example, aged \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 18 years). We excluded data from such studies in sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of the primary meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analyses. METHODS: Types of interventions METHODS: Treatment diet METHODS: We included RCTs investigating low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets where the diets were explicitly implemented for the primary purpose of reducing weight, with or without explicit advice to restrict total energy intake. METHODS: Control diet METHODS: We included RCTs where the control diets had a carbohydrate content within the balanced range of 45% to 65% of total energy, and where the diets were explicitly implemented for the primary purpose of reducing weight, with or without advice to restrict total energy intake. METHODS: We included studies where diets were implemented by provision of advice, food or both. However, we excluded studies with the following. METHODS: Treatment diet had carbohydrate content 45% or more of total energy or more than 150 g per day. METHODS: Treatment and control diets were different in some other respect that may influence the predefined outcomes, except for total energy intake. METHODS: Treatment or control diets were not adequately defined (and could not be obtained from study authors) or where the control diet was \u00e2\u0080\u0098no dietary intervention'. METHODS: Diets were combined with any other co\u00e2\u0080\u0090interventions (e.g. exercise, pharmacological, surgical) where these differed by group. METHODS: Dietary interventions had an exclusive focus on energy restriction (i.e. no macronutrient manipulation was explicitly instituted). METHODS: Interventions focused solely on specific foods (e.g. oats), food groups (e.g. dairy) or food components (e.g. plant sterols), or where meal replacements or supplements were part of the diets and were different in the diets being compared. METHODS: Participants were selected based on a possible prognostic variable (for example, genotype). METHODS: Types of outcome measures METHODS: We did not exclude studies on the basis of outcomes measured. However, we did exclude studies measuring only immediate meal responses (e.g. postprandial changes in blood sugar) and not longer\u00e2\u0080\u0090term physiological responses to diet. METHODS: Primary outcomes METHODS: Change in body weight (kg) from baseline METHODS: Number of participants per group with weight loss of at least 5% from baseline METHODS: We assessed the primary outcomes at short\u00e2\u0080\u0090term (3 months to < 12 months) and long\u00e2\u0080\u0090term (\u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months) follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up. METHODS: Secondary outcomes METHODS: Clinical METHODS: Change in body mass index (BMI; kg/m2) from baseline METHODS: Number of participants per group with reduction in BMI of at least 5% from baseline METHODS: We assessed the above clinical outcomes at short\u00e2\u0080\u0090term (three months to < 12 months) and long\u00e2\u0080\u0090term (\u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months) follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up. METHODS: Change in diastolic blood pressure (mmHg) METHODS: Change in systolic blood pressure (mmHg) METHODS: All\u00e2\u0080\u0090cause mortality METHODS: Cardiovascular mortality METHODS: Non\u00e2\u0080\u0090fatal myocardial infarction METHODS: Non\u00e2\u0080\u0090fatal stroke METHODS: Diagnosis of T2DM\u00c2\u00a0(as reported by study authors) METHODS: We assessed these clinical outcomes at long\u00e2\u0080\u0090term (\u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months) follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up only. METHODS: Laboratory METHODS: Change in glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) (%) METHODS: Change in serum low\u00e2\u0080\u0090density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (mmol/L) METHODS: Change in serum high\u00e2\u0080\u0090density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (mmol/L) METHODS: Change in serum non\u00e2\u0080\u0090HDL cholesterol (mmol/L) METHODS: Change in serum total cholesterol (mmol/L) METHODS: Change in serum triglycerides (mmol/L) METHODS: We assessed these laboratory outcomes at long\u00e2\u0080\u0090term (\u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months) follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up only. METHODS: Participant\u00e2\u0080\u0090reported adverse effects METHODS: Participant\u00e2\u0080\u0090reported adverse effects, specifically in regard to lack of appetite, bad breath, weakness, headaches, gastrointestinal problems (constipation, diarrhoea, flatulence, indigestion) and psychosocial problems (mood disturbances) at any time point, limited to those described in included studies. We regarded constipation as a patient\u00e2\u0080\u0090important outcome since it is frequently reported by people following low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets. METHODS: Search methods for identification of studies METHODS: We used a comprehensive search strategy aiming to identify all eligible studies regardless of language or publication status. METHODS: Electronic searches METHODS: We identified RCTs through systematic searches of the following bibliographic databases: METHODS: MEDLINE (PubMed, from 1946 to 25 June 2021) METHODS: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2021, Issue 6), in the Cochrane Library METHODS: Embase (Ovid, from 1947 to 28 June 2021) METHODS: Web of Science Core Collection with Indexes SCI\u00e2\u0080\u0090Expanded, SSCi, CPCI\u00e2\u0080\u0090S (Clarivate Analytics, from 1970 to 25 June 2021) METHODS: We also on 25 June 2021 searched ClinicalTrials.gov () and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP)\u00c2\u00a0for ongoing and unpublished trials (). METHODS: We first designed the search strategy for MEDLINE (PubMed) and then adapted it for use in the other sources (Appendix 1).\u00c2 METHODS: We did not do a separate search for adverse effects of interventions; we only considered adverse effects reported in included studies. METHODS: Searching other resources METHODS: We checked reference lists of all included studies and relevant systematic reviews identified for additional references to trials. We set out to examine any relevant retraction statements and errata for included studies; however, we did not come across any. METHODS: Data collection and analysis METHODS: Selection of studies METHODS: \u00c2\u00a0We imported all de\u00e2\u0080\u0090duplicated search records into\u00c2\u00a0Covidence. Two review authors independently screened the titles and abstracts of these records to identify all potential eligible studies. Discrepancies in first\u00e2\u0080\u0090line screening choices were resolved by discussion among at least two review authors. We retrieved the full\u00e2\u0080\u0090text report for each record that the screeners considered potentially eligible, and two review authors (CN, KN, AS, AB) independently screened all full texts, identifying studies for inclusion, and identifying and recording reasons for exclusion of the ineligible studies. We resolved any disagreement through discussion or, if required, consultation with a third review author (TY, JV). We identified and excluded duplicates and collated multiple reports of the same study so that each study, rather than each report, was the unit of interest in the review. We recorded the selection process in sufficient detail to complete a PRISMA flow diagram (Moher 2009), and 'Characteristics of excluded studies' table. Studies where full reports (published or unpublished) were not available (e.g. conference abstracts), or where there was unclear or missing information (that could not be obtained from study authors) such that we could not ascertain study eligibility, were placed, with a reason, in the 'Characteristics of studies awaiting classification' table. METHODS: Data extraction and management METHODS: To extract study characteristics and outcome data, we created a data collection form in DistillerSR (DistillerSR), and piloted it on two included studies. Data from each included study were extracted independently by two review authors (AB, KN, AS, CN). We contacted the study authors when reported information was unclear or contradictory, or when important data were missing. It was not necessary to seek translations. We extracted the following: METHODS: Methods: authors' contact details, type of record (e.g. journal article, thesis), study design, study population, study dates, total duration of the intervention and follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up duration after the intervention where relevant, details of 'run\u00e2\u0080\u0090in' periods where relevant, number of study centres and location, study setting, method of recruitment, number of study arms, description of eligible study arms, outcome used for sample size calculation, unit of allocation, number randomised per study arm (for individually\u00e2\u0080\u0090randomised trials), number of clusters and number of participants per cluster who consented (for cluster\u00e2\u0080\u0090randomised trials), number of withdrawals and those lost to follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up, number completed and analysed, other relevant notes on the methods. METHODS: Participants: inclusion and exclusion criteria, age, gender (number of male and female participants per group), baseline body weight status, other baseline cardiovascular disease risk factors and potential confounders, any group differences. METHODS: Interventions: treatment diet, control diet, implementation or delivery of diets, dietary intake assessments (e.g. what, how frequent, by whom), concomitant interventions. METHODS: Outcomes: primary and secondary outcomes specified and collected at relevant time points, data on adherence to the interventions, and whether primary study authors analysed results separately according to gender. METHODS: Notes: study funding, conflicts of interest declarations of study authors, and other relevant notes. METHODS: For outcomes, we extracted change data (i.e. change from baseline to outcome assessment per group) where possible, with relevant data on variance for treatment and control arms and numbers of participants per arm at that time point. Where change data were not available, we extracted and used data at study end (i.e. end values), or other relevant time points, along with variance and number of participants per arm at that time point.\u00c2 METHODS: Where possible, we converted variables to comparable units to allow pooling of data, if appropriate.\u00c2\u00a0Calleja\u00e2\u0080\u0090Fern\u00c3\u00a1ndez 2012\u00c2\u00a0stratified by homeostatic model assessment (insulin resistant (IR) and insulin sensitive (IS)) before randomisation. We combined IR and IS group data using Cochrane methods to combine subgroups (Higgins 2021).\u00c2\u00a0Saslow 2017a\u00c2\u00a0reported appetite change as hunger change scores using means and Cohen's d values for each diet group. We converted Cohen's d values to standard deviations (SD) using the formula SD = mean/Cohen's d.\u00c2 METHODS: We stratified included trials into those in participants without T2DM (comparisons 1 and 2)\u00c2\u00a0and those in participants with T2DM (comparisons 3 and 4).\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2 METHODS: We resolved disagreements by consensus or by involving a third review author (MC, TY, JV). We exported data from DistillerSR and imported it into the latest version of Review Manager Web (RevMan Web 2020) via Microsoft Excel. We completed the 'Characteristics of included studies' table for all included studies. We used key items from the TIDieR checklist (Hoffman 2014) to aid description, interpretation and discussion of the results. Brief details of ongoing studies are reported in the 'Characteristics of ongoing studies' table, and these studies will be considered for inclusion in a future update of the review. METHODS: Assessment of risk of bias in included studies METHODS: Three reviewers (CN, AB and AS) assessed risk of bias for each study using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool (RoB2) for randomised controlled trials (Sterne 2019). This tool was used to assess the effect of the assignment to the intervention, for the following domains: METHODS: bias arising from the randomisation process; METHODS: bias due to deviations from intended interventions; METHODS: bias due to missing outcome data; METHODS: bias in measurement of the outcome; METHODS: bias in selection of the reported result. METHODS: We did not have to carry out the planned assessments of risk of bias for cross\u00e2\u0080\u0090over and cluster\u00e2\u0080\u0090randomised controlled trials, as none of the eligible trials had these designs.\u00c2 METHODS: We judged each domain as either 'low risk of bias', 'some concerns' or 'high risk of bias' for the following outcomes reported in the summary of findings tables: METHODS: change in body weight (kg) measured from baseline to between three and < 12 months; METHODS: change in body weight (kg) measured from baseline to \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months; METHODS: number of participants per group with weight loss of at least 5% measured from baseline to \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months; METHODS: cardiovascular mortality measured from baseline to \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months; METHODS: change in diastolic blood pressure (mmHg) measured from baseline to \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months; METHODS: change in HbA1c (%) (for\u00c2\u00a0comparisons in participants with T2DM) measured from baseline to \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months; METHODS: change in serum LDL cholesterol (mmol/L) measured from baseline to \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months; METHODS: participant\u00e2\u0080\u0090reported constipation at any time point from baseline to three and < 12 months. METHODS: Overall, per included study, we made judgements according to the following criteria: METHODS: low risk of bias: when all domains were at low risk; METHODS: some concerns: when one or more domains had some concerns, but none were at a high risk of bias; METHODS: high risk of bias: when one or more domains were at high risk of bias, or multiple domains had some concerns to the extent that these reduced confidence in the results. METHODS: We resolved any disagreements by discussion or by involving another review author(MC or AS). METHODS: Measures of treatment effect METHODS: For dichotomous data, we used the number of events as the numerator and the total sample size per outcome as the denominator in each relevant comparison group and computed the risk ratio (RR) (available case data). For continuous data, we reported results per outcome as the difference in the mean change (and, if not available, the difference in end values) between the treatment and control groups, and computed the mean difference (MD) (available case data). We entered data presented as a scale with a consistent direction of effect. We used Review Manager Web to conduct meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analyses for each outcome, where appropriate, to determine a pooled effect of low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets compared to balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets. We narratively described skewed data reported as medians and interquartile ranges. METHODS: Unit of analysis issues METHODS: In the case of multiple intervention groups, we selected one pair of interventions (treatment and control) most relevant to this systematic review question. We did not need to apply the planned approach for unit of analysis issues related to clustering as no cluster\u00e2\u0080\u0090randomised trials were eligible. Where a study reported outcome data for more than one time point within our time point categories (3 months to < 12 months; and \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months), we used the longest time point (for example, where results were available at three months and five months, we only used the five\u00e2\u0080\u0090month data). METHODS: Dealing with missing data METHODS: We contacted study authors or sponsors to clarify key study characteristics and obtain missing numerical outcome data, where needed. Where study authors had not reported all relevant statistics per outcome (for example, sample size, mean change and standard deviation of change per group), we calculated or estimated the required data from other reported statistics using formulas specified in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011), if possible. Where we could not calculate or estimate these statistics with reasonable confidence, we contacted the study authors by email. When we did not receive a response, we did not impute the missing values, but reported the available results narratively or in a table, as appropriate. For interventions in which there was substantial attrition (15% or more for at least one of the groups) of study participants, we reported the attrition rate. We also performed sensitivity analyses excluding studies with some concerns or a high risk of bias for the missing outcome data domain in RoB 2. METHODS: Assessment of heterogeneity METHODS: We examined heterogeneity per outcome firstly by visual inspection of the forest plots (i.e. we looked at physical overlap of confidence intervals across the included studies). Secondly, we assessed statistical heterogeneity among the intervention effects across the included studies in each meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis as follows: METHODS: Chi2 test for heterogeneity METHODS: I2 statistic to quantify heterogeneity METHODS: Tau2 statistic to measure the extent of heterogeneity METHODS: In our meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analyses, we considered substantial heterogeneity as an I2 statistic value of greater than 50% and either a Chi2 test of less than 0.1 or Tau2 statistic greater than 0. In meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analyses with substantial heterogeneity, we performed prespecified subgroup analyses on the outcomes in the summary of findings tables. Where we identified unexplained substantial heterogeneity, we did not pool results into an overall effect estimate but rather presented the individual effect sizes per study for the specific outcome.\u00c2 METHODS: Assessment of reporting biases METHODS: Where data per comparison and outcome allowed us to pool more than 10 studies, we explored the possibility of small study biases for the primary outcomes using funnel plots. In the case of asymmetry, we considered various explanations such as publication bias, poor study design and the effect of study size. METHODS: Data synthesis METHODS: We used a random\u00e2\u0080\u0090effects model for meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analyses since we anticipated heterogeneity between included studies due to variations in the composition of weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090loss diets, adherence to diets, intervention duration and dietary assessment methodology. For dichotomous outcomes, we used the Mantel\u00e2\u0080\u0090Haenszel method, unless the number of events were not available but estimates of effect measure and their standard errors were, in which case we used the inverse variance method. For continuous outcomes, we used the inverse variance method. METHODS: We analysed trials in overweight and obese participants without T2DM\u00c2\u00a0following diets with a weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phase only (comparison 1), or a weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phase followed by a weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phase (comparison 2); as well as overweight and obese participants with T2DM\u00c2\u00a0following diets with a weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phase only (comparison 3), or a weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phase followed by a weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phase (comparison 4). These analyses were done separately, where possible, as the presence of diabetes is likely to influence the effects of the diets. When not explicitly stated, we regarded weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phases as periods where initial diet prescriptions or advice changed to indicate less focus on active weight reduction, for example, changes in energy prescriptions or no restrictions on carbohydrate intake.\u00c2 METHODS: We analysed outcome data at the time point \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months, because it captures sustainability of effects on weight loss, clinical, as well as laboratory outcomes. However, for the weight and BMI outcomes, we also analysed data at the time point three months to < 12 months, as many people going on weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090loss diets are especially interested to know how fast they would be losing weight, and experienced weight loss over the short term also serves as motivation to keep going longer term. METHODS: We preferentially extracted and used data from the intention\u00e2\u0080\u0090to\u00e2\u0080\u0090treat (ITT) analyses of trials (as reported by trial authors) in all our meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analyses. By ITT, we mean that randomised participants were analysed according to the group to which they were randomised; however, if there were missing data we did not perform any imputations. METHODS: Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity METHODS: Where data allowed, we carried out the following subgroup analyses for the outcomes in the summary of findings tables, to explore substantial heterogeneity and the stability of findings in different study subgroups, as follows. METHODS: By extent of carbohydrate restriction (i.e. very low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate or ketogenic diets: carbohydrate prescription of \u00e2\u0089\u00a4 50 g per day or < 10% of total daily energy intake from a nominal 8400 kilojoule (approximately 2000 kilocalories) diet; and non\u00e2\u0080\u0090ketogenic low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets: > 50 g to 150 g per day or < 45% of total energy intake) METHODS: By similarity of total energy prescription (i.e. studies with substantial differences in daily total energy prescription (> 500 kilojoules or approximately 120 kilocalories) in treatment and control groups, for example, ad libitum energy prescription in the treatment diet and restricted energy prescription in the control diet, studies with similar energy prescription or similar approach used to restrict energy intake in treatment and control groups, studies with no energy prescription reported or unrestricted energy intake prescribed in both treatment and control groups) METHODS: By diagnosed cardiovascular event or disease (i.e. studies in people with no events or disease, studies in people with events or disease, and studies in people with and without events or disease) METHODS: By gender METHODS: Sensitivity analysis METHODS: Where data allowed, we carried out sensitivity analyses for primary outcomes, assessing the effect of: METHODS: overall low risk and 'some concerns' of bias (i.e. we first pooled all relevant studies per outcome, and then pooled only studies with overall low risk and 'some concerns' of bias); METHODS: attrition bias (i.e. we first pooled all relevant studies per outcome, and then pooled only studies at low risk of bias for the missing outcome data domain); METHODS: studies including only a subset of eligible participants for this review (i.e. we first pooled all relevant studies per outcome, and then pooled only studies that included only participants eligible for inclusion in this review);\u00c2 METHODS: clustering (i.e. we first pooled all relevant studies per outcome, and then pooled only studies that randomised individual participants); and METHODS: source of funding (i.e. we first pooled studies with all funding sources, and then pooled only studies without diet/food industry funding). METHODS: Summary of findings and assessment of the certainty of the evidence METHODS: Based on the methods described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011), we prepared four summary of findings tables, one for each comparison in participants without and with T2DM. In these tables, we included change in body weight (kg) measured from baseline to between three and < 12 months, and the following outcomes measured from baseline to \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: change in body weight (kg); number of participants per group with weight loss of at least 5%; cardiovascular mortality; change in diastolic blood pressure (mmHg); change in HbA1c (%) (for comparisons 3 and 4 in participants with T2DM); change in serum LDL cholesterol (mmol/L), as well as participant\u00e2\u0080\u0090reported constipation at 3 to < 12 months. We used the GRADE approach to rank the certainty of the evidence as it related to the studies that contributed data to the meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analyses for the prespecified outcomes, using GRADEpro GDT software (). The GRADE tool includes five considerations (study limitations, inconsistencies of results, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias) to assess the certainty of the evidence from RCTs. METHODS: We justified all decisions to downgrade the quality of evidence using footnotes, and made comments to aid readers' understanding where necessary. METHODS: Three review authors (CN, AS, AB) made judgements about evidence certainty, with disagreements resolved by discussion, and involving a third review author where needed. METHODS: We extracted study data, formatted our comparisons in data tables and prepared a summary of findings table for each of the four comparisons\u00c2\u00a0before writing the results and conclusions of our review.

Additional information, such as support for judgements, is located\u00c2\u00a0in the\u00c2\u00a0risk of bias\u00c2\u00a0section (located after the\u00c2\u00a0Characteristics of ongoing studies).\u00c2 FIG: Risk of bias figure: systematic review authors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 judgements about each risk of bias item presented as percentages across all included trials for bias arising from the randomisation process, and across all outcomes in the Summary of Findings tables for all other items using the Cochrane risk of bias 2 tool RESULTS: For most trials in participants without T2DM, the risk of bias arising from the randomisation process was judged as having 'some concerns' (n = 25), 10 trials were judged as low risk (Bales 2017;\u00c2\u00a0Dyson 2007;\u00c2\u00a0Ebbeling 2007;\u00c2\u00a0Gardner 2007;\u00c2\u00a0Griffin 2013;\u00c2\u00a0Haufe 2013;\u00c2\u00a0Jesudason 2013;\u00c2\u00a0Liu 2013;\u00c2\u00a0Marco\u00e2\u0080\u0090Benedi 2019;\u00c2\u00a0Sacks 2009), and four trials as high risk for this domain (Keogh 2007;\u00c2\u00a0Parr 2016;\u00c2\u00a0Tay 2008;\u00c2\u00a0Wycherley 2012). The overall risk of bias of outcomes across trials in participants without T2DM was similar and predominantly high. High overall risk of bias judgements were mostly as a result of bias due to missing outcome data, with high proportions of missing outcome data in many trials and this not being adequately handled by recommended statistical approaches. Bias due to deviations from intended interventions also contributed to high overall risk of bias. Problems with the measurement of outcomes did not contribute to high overall risk as most outcomes were not subjective or observer\u00e2\u0080\u0090reported; the exception was constipation, which was participant\u00e2\u0080\u0090reported and judged as high risk for most of the trials. None of the trials for any outcome in participants without T2DM reported prespecified analysis intentions in sufficient detail to enable assessment of selection of the reported result. Three trials did not contribute any numeric data to meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analyses and risk of bias for these trials was not assessed, in line with guidance on implementing RoB 2 (Foster 2003;\u00c2\u00a0Pittas 2005;\u00c2\u00a0Racette 1995).\u00c2\u00a0Five trials did not report any outcomes included in the summary of findings tables, and we did not assess risk of bias of these (Juanola\u00e2\u0080\u0090Falgarona 2014;\u00c2\u00a0Kitabchi 2013;\u00c2\u00a0Ruth 2013;\u00c2\u00a0Samaha 2003;\u00c2\u00a0Stentz 2016).\u00c2 RESULTS: Bias arising from the randomisation process was judged as low risk for approximately half of the trials in participants with T2DM (n = 8) (Dyson 2007;\u00c2\u00a0Evangelista 2021;\u00c2\u00a0Krebs 2012;\u00c2\u00a0Larsen 2011;\u00c2\u00a0Pedersen 2014;\u00c2\u00a0Saslow 2017a;\u00c2\u00a0Sato 2017;\u00c2\u00a0Watson 2016), with the remaining trials judged as having 'some concerns' (Elhayany 2010;\u00c2\u00a0Guldbrand 2012;\u00c2\u00a0Samaha 2003;\u00c2\u00a0Tay 2014;\u00c2\u00a0Westman 2008;\u00c2\u00a0Wycherley 2010;\u00c2\u00a0Yamada 2014). Across trials in participants with T2DM, the overall risk of bias of outcomes was similar and mostly high. As in the trials in participants without T2DM, the high overall risk of bias judgements were largely driven by bias due to missing outcome data, with high proportions of missing data not being adequately handled, and to a lesser extent by bias due to deviations from intended interventions. None of the trials in participants with T2DM reported prespecified analysis intentions in sufficient detail to enable us to assess the selection of the reported result. We did not assess risk of bias for one older study as it did not contribute usable data for an outcome included in the summary of findings tables (Hockaday 1978).\u00c2 RESULTS: Effects of interventions RESULTS: See: Table 1; Table 2; Table 3; Table 4 RESULTS: See:\u00c2\u00a0Table 1;\u00c2\u00a0Table 2;\u00c2\u00a0Table 3;\u00c2\u00a0Table 4. RESULTS: We analysed results from trials in overweight and obese participants without T2DM separately from those in participants with T2DM. We also separated analyses for weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phases of diets, and for weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phases followed by weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phases. We report here the effects on the prespecified outcomes according to the four comparisons resulting from these stratifications.\u00c2 RESULTS: We assessed the follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up periods for the various outcomes as short term (three to < 12 months) or long term (\u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months). The exact author\u00e2\u0080\u0090reported follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up periods per outcome per trial appear as footnotes in each forest plot (i.e. using weeks, months or years). To summarise the follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up period applicable per outcome, we also reported the specific follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up range across all the trials that reported on that outcome. RESULTS: None of the included trials reported on the following outcomes for any of the four comparisons: all\u00e2\u0080\u0090cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, non\u00e2\u0080\u0090fatal myocardial infarction, non\u00e2\u0080\u0090fatal stroke and diagnosis of T2DM.

If only end values were reported for a given outcome, a mean change value was calculated by using the mean baseline value and subtracting it from the reported mean end value.\u00c2 RESULTS: Comparison 1.

The meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis showed little to no difference in weight reduction on average between low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate and balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diet groups (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00901.07 kg, (95% confidence interval (CI) \u00e2\u0080\u00901.55 to \u00e2\u0080\u00900.59, I2 = 51%, 3286 participants, 37 RCTs,\u00c2\u00a0moderate\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 1.1) over three to 8.5 months. This lack of a difference in effect was confirmed by sensitivity analyses, including only trials with 'some concerns' of bias overall (Analysis 1.6; no trials at overall low risk of bias), those at low risk of attrition bias (Analysis 1.7) and those without reported diet/food industry funding (Analysis 1.8).\u00c2 RESULTS: Subgrouping by similarity of energy prescription (Analysis 1.2), extent of carbohydrate restriction (Analysis 1.3), diagnosed cardiovascular event or disease at baseline (Analysis 1.4) or gender (Analysis 1.5) did not suggest important clinical differences in average effects between subgroups, with mean differences in weight reduction in overweight and obese participants at three to < 12 months ranging between 0.25 kg and 2.71 kg across the various subgroups. Subgrouping by similarity of energy prescription and extent of carbohydrate restriction explained some heterogeneity. Heterogeneity was reduced (I2 = 0%) in the subgroup including only trials with similar energy prescriptions/approaches to energy restriction in both diets, and in the subgroup including only trials investigating low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets (> 50 g to 150 g per day or < 45% of total energy intake). We did not downgrade for inconsistency. The subgroup including only trials with no energy prescriptions or unrestricted energy prescriptions in both diets had small total numbers of participants (n < 400). This was also the case for the subgroup of trials only including men.\u00c2 RESULTS: Nine trials reported this outcome in an unusable format (e.g. in figures or as percentage change in weight from baseline) and usable data were not provided when authors were contacted (Table 8). The funnel plot (Figure 3) shows most trials had similar standard errors of intervention effect estimates limiting the ability to assess asymmetry. The mean difference in fixed\u00e2\u0080\u0090effect analysis, which gives less weight to small studies (\u00e2\u0080\u00900.91 kg, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00901.21 to \u00e2\u0080\u00900.62), is similar to the mean difference in random\u00e2\u0080\u0090effects meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis (\u00e2\u0080\u00901.07 kg, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00901.55 to \u00e2\u0080\u00900.59,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 1.1), which gives more weight to smaller studies, suggesting that any small\u00e2\u0080\u0090study effects have little effect on the intervention effect estimate. FIG: Funnel plot for change in weight at 3 to < 12 months (Analysis 1.1) in comparison 1 RESULTS: Thirteen of the 37 trials had follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up at three months from baseline, nine at four months, 13 at six months, one at 26 weeks (about 6.5 months), and one trial at 34 weeks (about 8.5 months) RESULTS: Change in body weight (kg) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months RESULTS: GRADE assessment suggests that low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets probably result in little to no difference to change in body weight over one to two years compared to balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets in overweight and obese participants without T2DM (moderate\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias). RESULTS: Long\u00e2\u0080\u0090term average weight reductions in the 14 trials that reported this outcome ranged from 13.1 kg to 2.46 kg in low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diet groups and from 11.6 kg to 1.7 kg in balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diet groups. The meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis of the mean difference in weight reduction between the low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate and balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets demonstrated little to no difference at one to two years (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00900.93 kg, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00901.81 to \u00e2\u0080\u00900.04, I2 = 40%, 1805 participants, 14 RCTs,\u00c2\u00a0moderate\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 1.9). Sensitivity analyses including only trials at low risk of attrition bias (Analysis 1.10) and trials without diet/food industry funding confirmed this lack of a difference in effect (Analysis 1.11). Other planned sensitivity analyses included fewer than two studies and thus were not performed. RESULTS: Two trials reported this outcome in an unusable format (e.g. in figures or as percentage change in weight from baseline) and usable data were not provided when authors were contacted (Table 8). The funnel plot (Figure 4) suggests that smaller studies may be missing. The mean difference in fixed\u00e2\u0080\u0090effect analysis, which gave less weight to small studies (\u00e2\u0080\u00900.81 kg, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00901.43 to \u00e2\u0080\u00900.19), was similar to the mean difference in the random\u00e2\u0080\u0090effects meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis (\u00e2\u0080\u00900.93 kg, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00901.81 to \u00e2\u0080\u00900.04,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 1.9), which gave more weight to smaller studies, suggesting that any small\u00e2\u0080\u0090study effects had little effect on the intervention effect estimate. FIG: Funnel plot for change in weight at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months (Analysis 1.9) in comparison 1 RESULTS: Ten of the 14 trials had follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up at one year, one at 15 months, one at 74 weeks (about 18.5 months), with the two longest trials having follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up at two years. RESULTS: Number of participants per group with weight loss of at least 5% at three to < 12 months RESULTS: The number of participants achieving at least 5% weight loss over the short term in the three trials reporting this outcome ranged from 14 to 41 with low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets and from eight to 35 with balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets. The meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis of the risk ratio (RR) of the number of participants per group with weight loss of at least 5% at three to six months was 1.30 (95% CI 1.00 to 1.68, I2 = 47%, 161 participants, 3 RCTs,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 1.12) when comparing low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate and balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diet groups. Two of the three trials that reported this outcome had follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up at three months and the other at six months. RESULTS: Number of participants per group with weight loss of at least 5% at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months RESULTS: GRADE assessment suggests that the evidence is very uncertain about whether there is a difference in the number of participants per group with weight loss of at least 5% at one year, when comparing low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets with balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets in overweight and obese participants without T2DM (very low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence; downgraded once for risk of bias and twice for imprecision). RESULTS: Two studies reported on this outcome at one year (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.31; I\u00c2\u00b2 = 17%; 137 participants, 2 RCTs,\u00c2\u00a0very low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 1.13), with the number of participants achieving at least 5% weight loss ranging from 28 to 30 in the low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing group and from 27 to 29 in the balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing group. Another included trial also measured this outcome at two years but it was not reported in a usable format (Table 8).\u00c2 RESULTS: Secondary outcomes RESULTS: For comparison 1, no trials reported on the number of participants per group with reduction in BMI (kg/m2) of at least 5% at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months. RESULTS: Change in BMI (kg/m2) at three to < 12 months RESULTS: Twenty\u00e2\u0080\u0090one trials (n = 1517 participants) reported on short\u00e2\u0080\u0090term BMI change for comparison 1, with five of the 20 trials having follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up at three months, five at four months and 11 trials at six months. Across the trials, average reduction in BMI from baseline ranged from 4.7 kg/m2 to 1.8 kg/m2 with low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets and from 3.7 kg/m2 to 0.98 kg/m2 with balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diet groups. We did not pool these results into an overall effect estimate due to substantial heterogeneity (I\u00c2\u00b2 = 53%, Tau\u00c2\u00b2 = 0.18; Chi\u00c2\u00b2 = 42.52, df = 20 (P = 0.002)) but rather presented the individual effect sizes between the low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate and balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets per study\u00c2\u00a0(Analysis 1.14).\u00c2 RESULTS: Change in BMI (kg/m2) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months RESULTS: Average reduction in BMI from baseline over the long term in the five trials reporting this outcome ranged from 5.2 kg/m2 to 1.65 kg/m2 in low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diet groups and from 4.1 kg/m2 to 0.92 kg/m2 in balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diet groups.\u00c2\u00a0When low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets were compared to balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets, the difference in BMI change on average at one to two years was \u00e2\u0080\u00900.61 kg/m2 (95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00900.99 to \u00e2\u0080\u00900.23, I2 = 0%, 490 participants, 5 RCTs,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 1.15). Four trials had follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up at one year and the remaining trial at two years. RESULTS: Number of participants per group with reduction in BMI (kg/m2) of at least 5% at three to < 12 months RESULTS: A single small study reported on this outcome at three months and the risk ratio was 1.57 (95% CI 0.79 to 3.12, 55 participants, 1 RCT,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 1.16) with 14 participants in the low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing group and eight participants in the balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing group achieving at least 5% reduction in BMI. RESULTS: Change in DBP (mmHg) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months RESULTS: GRADE assessment suggests that low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets probably result in little to no difference to change in DBP compared to balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets over one to two years in overweight and obese participants without T2DM (moderate\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias). RESULTS: Over one to two years, average change in DBP from baseline ranged from a 9 mmHg reduction to a 4 mmHg increase with low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets and from an 11 mmHg reduction to 2.9 mmHg increase with balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets across the 11 trials that reported this. The meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis of the mean difference in change in DBP between the low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate and balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets demonstrated little to no difference at one to two years (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00900.09 mmHg, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00901.29 to 1.12, I2 = 44%, 1419 participants, 11 RCTs, moderate\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 1.17). Seven of the 11 trials had follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up at one year, one at 15 months, one at 18 months and the other two trials at two years. RESULTS: Change in SBP (mmHg) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months RESULTS: Average change in SBP from baseline in the 11 trials reporting this outcome ranged from reductions of 13.8 mmHg to 0.2 mmHg in low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diet groups and from a reduction of 14.6 mmHg to an increase of 1.7 mmHg in balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diet groups over one to two years of follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up. For this comparison, the mean difference in change in SBP at one to two years was \u00e2\u0080\u00901.37 mmHg (95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00902.99 to 0.24, I2 = 34%, 1397 participants, 11 RCTs,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 1.18). Seven of the 11 trials had follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up at one year, one at 15 months, one at 18 months and the other two trials at two years. RESULTS: Change in LDL cholesterol (mmol/L) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months RESULTS: GRADE assessment suggests that low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets probably result in little to no difference in change in LDL cholesterol over one to two years compared to balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets in overweight and obese participants without T2DM (moderate\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias). RESULTS: Over one to two years, average change in LDL cholesterol from baseline across the 13 trials that reported this outcome ranged from reduction of 0.3 mmol/L to an increase of 0.6 mmol/L with low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets and from a reduction of 0.31 mmol/L to an increase of 0.1 mmol/L with balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets. The meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis of the mean difference in change in LDL cholesterol between the low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate and balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets demonstrated little to no difference at one to two years (MD 0.04 mmol/L 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00900.05 to 0.12, I2 = 33%, 1494 participants, 13 RCTs, moderate\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 1.19). Nine of the 13 trials had follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up at one year, one at 15 months, one at 18 months and the other two trials at two years. One of the included trials measured this outcome but it was not reported in a usable format (Table 8).\u00c2 RESULTS: Change in HDL cholesterol (mmol/L) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months RESULTS: Average change in HDL cholesterol from baseline over one to two years ranged from a reduction of 0.1 mmol/L to an increase of 0.3 mmol/L in low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diet groups and from a reduction of 0.21 mmol/L to an increase of 0.18 mmol/L in balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diet groups in the 13 trials that reported this outcome. When low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets were compared to balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets, the mean difference in change in HDL cholesterol at one to two years was 0.06 mmol/L (95% CI 0.02 to 0.10, I2 = 48%, 1519 participants, 13 RCTs,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 1.20). Nine of the 13 trials had follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up at one year, one at 15 months, one at 18 months and the other two trials at two years. RESULTS: Change in non\u00e2\u0080\u0090HDL cholesterol (mmol/L) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months RESULTS: Two small studies reported on this outcome at one year and the mean difference in non\u00e2\u0080\u0090HDL cholesterol was 0.06 mmol/L (95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00900.2 to 0.33, I2 = 47%, 225 participants, 2 RCTs,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 1.21) with average change in non\u00e2\u0080\u0090HDL ranging from a reduction of 0.13 mmol/L to an increase of 0.24 mmol/L in low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing groups and average reductions ranging from 0.1 mmol/L to 0.02 mmol/L in balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing groups.\u00c2 RESULTS: Change in total cholesterol (mmol/L) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months RESULTS: Over one to two years, average change in total cholesterol from baseline ranged from a reduction of 0.4 mmol/L to an increase of 0.7 mmol/L with low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets and from a reduction of 0.42 mmol/L to an increase of 0.13 mmol/L with balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets across the 11 trials that reported this. On average, there was no difference in change in total cholesterol at one to two years between the two types of diet (MD 0.01 mmol/L, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00900.1 to 0.12, I2 = 41%, 1291 participants, 11 RCTs,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 1.22). Eight of the 11 trials had follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up at one year, one at 15 months and the other two trials at two years. RESULTS: Change in triglycerides (mmol/L) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months RESULTS: Across the 13 trials that reported on triglycerides over one to two years, average change from baseline ranged from reductions of 0.58 mmol/L to 0.1 mmol/L with low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets and from a reduction of 0.44 mmol/L to an increase of 0.02 mmol/L with balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets. For this comparison, the mean difference in change in triglycerides at one to two years was \u00e2\u0080\u00900.11 mmol/L (95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00900.16 to \u00e2\u0080\u00900.06, I2 = 0%, 1559 participants, 13 RCTs,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 1.23). Nine of the 13 trials had follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up at one year, one at 15 months, one at 18 months and the other two trials at two years. RESULTS: Participant\u00e2\u0080\u0090reported adverse effects RESULTS: Participant\u00e2\u0080\u0090reported adverse effects were scantily reported by six included trials for comparison 1, with all outcomes except short\u00e2\u0080\u0090term constipation being reported only by single trials, and one of the trials reporting on most of these outcomes (Bazzano 2014). All 19 dichotomous outcomes reported very few events, had small total sample sizes and had wide 95% CIs. The four continuous outcomes all had small total samples sizes, mean differences close to 0 and wide 95% CIs. RESULTS: Gastrointestinal RESULTS: GRADE assessment suggests that the evidence is very uncertain about whether there is a difference in the number of participants per group with constipation at three to six months when comparing low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets with balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets in overweight and obese participants without T2DM (very low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias and twice for imprecision).\u00c2 RESULTS: The meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis of the risk ratio of the number of participants per group reporting constipation at three to six months was 1.06 (95% CI 0.81 to 1.38, I2 = 0%, 564 participants, 4 RCTs,\u00c2\u00a0very low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 1.24) when comparing the two diet groups.\u00c2 RESULTS: One trial reported constipation at one year (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.25, 148 participants, 1 RCT,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 1.25). RESULTS: Two trials reported on events of diarrhoea finding no difference over the shorter term (at three months and at six months) (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.33 to 2.93, 244 participants, 2 RCTs,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 1.26) or at one year (RR 0.32, 95% CI\u00c2\u00a00.03 to 3.05, 148 participants, 1 RCT,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 1.27). This was also the case for nausea over the shorter term (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.05 to 10.68, 244 participants, 2 RCTs,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 1.28) and at one year (RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.65, 148 participants, 1 RCT,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 1.29).\u00c2 RESULTS: One trial reported on events offlatulence at six months (RR 0.75, 95% CI\u00c2\u00a00.44 to 1.30, 148 participants, 1 RCT,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 1.30) and again at one year (RR 0.68 95% CI\u00c2\u00a00.39 to 1.17, 148 participants, 1 RCT,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 1.31), as well on events of heartburn at six months (RR 0.53, 95% CI\u00c2\u00a00.21 to 1.36, 148 participants, 1 RCT,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 1.32) and at one year (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.01, 148 participants, 1 RCT,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 1.33). RESULTS: One trial reported on halitosis at six months (RR 1.99, 95% CI 1.32 to 2.99, 263 participants, 1 RCT,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 1.34) and another trial reported stomach upsets at three months (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.41 to 2.45, 96 participants, 1 RCT,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 1.35). RESULTS: Appetite and hunger RESULTS: Appetite change was reported by one trial at six months follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up (RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.01 to 3.99, 148 participants, 1 RCT,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 1.36) and at one year (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.05 to 5.25, 148 participants, 1 RCT,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 1.37). RESULTS: In another trial, hunger and desire to eat were gauged using a visual analog score as change from baseline at one year for this comparison. The mean score for hunger was \u00e2\u0080\u00901.05 (SEM 0.56; n = 21) in the low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diet group and \u00e2\u0080\u00900.18 (SEM 0.66; n = 15) in the balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diet group. Mean scores for desire to eat were \u00e2\u0080\u00901.02 (SEM 0.59; n = 21) in the low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diet group and \u00e2\u0080\u00900.16 (SEM 0.76; n = 15) in the balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diet group (Griffin 2013). RESULTS: Fatigue RESULTS: One trial reported on events offatigue at six months (RR 0.80, 95% CI\u00c2\u00a00.47 to 1.36, 148 participants, 1 RCT,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 1.38) and at one year (RR 0.91, 95% CI\u00c2\u00a00.49 to 1.71, 148 participants, 1 RCT,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 1.39). RESULTS: Headaches RESULTS: Two trials reported on headaches with no difference over the shorter term (at three months and at six months) (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.26 to 6.02, I2 = 55%, 244 participants, 2 RCTs,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 1.40) or at one year (RR 0.49, 95% CI\u00c2\u00a00.25 to 0.93, 148 participants, 1 RCT,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 1.41). RESULTS: Psychosocial problems (mood disturbances) RESULTS: A single trial measured events of reported anxiety at three months follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up for comparison 1 (RR 1.0, 95% CI 0.07 to 15.26, 60 participants, 1 RCT,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 1.42). RESULTS: One trial reportedtotal mood disturbance scores according to the Profile of Mood States (POMS) at three months (MD 1.91, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00908.06 to 11.88, 118 participants, 1 RCT,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 1.43) and one year (MD 2.87, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00908.48 to 14.22, 118 participants, 1 RCT,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 1.44). RESULTS: \u00c2\u00a0At four months follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up, one trial reported depressive symptoms according to the Beck Depression Inventory (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00900.30, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00901.36 to 0.76, 217 participants, 1 RCT,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 1.45) and anxiety symptoms according to the State\u00e2\u0080\u0090Trait Anxiety Inventory (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00900.20, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00901.44 to 1.04, 217 participants, 1 RCT,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 1.46). RESULTS: Comparison 2. Low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets versus balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets in overweight and obese participants without T2DM (weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phase followed by weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phase) RESULTS: Table 2\u00c2\u00a0presents the effects of low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets compared to balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets (weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phase followed by weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phase) in overweight and obese participants without T2DM on long\u00e2\u0080\u0090term (\u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months) changes in body weight, DBP and LDL cholesterol. RESULTS: Key details about studies in this comparison, including characteristics of the intervention, population, outcomes and method of synthesis are detailed in the OSIS table (Table 10). RESULTS: Primary outcomes RESULTS: The only primary outcome reported by the included trials for comparison 2 was change in body weight at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months. RESULTS: Change in body weight (kg) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months RESULTS: GRADE assessment suggests that low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets that include a weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phase may result in little to no difference in change in body weight over one to two years compared to balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets that include a weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phase in overweight and obese participants without T2DM (low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias and once for imprecision). RESULTS: Over the long term, average weight change from baseline ranged from a reduction of 5.4 kg to an increase of 0.86 kg with low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets and from reductions of 5.5 kg to 1.5 kg with balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets across the three trials that reported this outcome. The meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis of the mean difference in weight reduction between the low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate and balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets demonstrated little to no difference at one to two years (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00900.30 kg, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00902.77 to 2.16, I2 = 0%, 73 participants, 3 RCTs,\u00c2\u00a0low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 2.1). One of the trials had a weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phase of 12 weeks followed by a weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phase of 40 weeks, measuring change in weight at one year. The other two trials measured change in weight at two years, with one trial testing a three\u00e2\u0080\u0090month weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phase followed by a 21\u00e2\u0080\u0090month maintenance phase, and the other trial testing a 6\u00e2\u0080\u0090month weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phase followed by a maintenance\u00e2\u0080\u0090phase that averaged 18 months in duration. This lack of a difference in effect was confirmed by a sensitivity analysis including only the two trials without reported diet/food industry funding (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00900.80 kg, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00903.48 to 1.88, I2 = 0%, 63 participants, 2 RCTs, analysis not shown).\u00c2 RESULTS: Secondary outcomes RESULTS: The only secondary outcomes reported by the included trials for comparison 2 were changes in DBP, SBP, LDL and HDL cholesterol, total cholesterol and triglycerides. \u00c2 RESULTS: Changes in DBP and SBP (mmHg) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months RESULTS: GRADE assessment suggests that the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets that include a weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phase compared to balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets that include a weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phase on change in DBP at one year in overweight and obese participants without T2DM (very low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias and twice for imprecision). RESULTS: One very small trial compared these diets using a weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phase of 12 weeks followed by a maintenance phase of 40 weeks, and reported on changes in DBP (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00906.0 mmHg, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u009017.55 to 5.55, 13 participants, 1 RCT,\u00c2\u00a0very low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 2.2) and SBP\u00c2\u00a0(MD \u00e2\u0080\u009015.0 mmHg, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u009032.36 to 2.36, 13 participants, 1 RCT,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 2.3) at one year. The study reported average DBP reductions from baseline of 4 mmHg in the low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diet group and of 6 mmHg in the balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diet group. For SBP, the study reported an average decrease from baseline of 2 mmHg in the low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate group and an increase of 2 mmHg in the balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate group. RESULTS: Changes in LDL, HDL and total cholesterol and triglycerides (mmol/L) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months RESULTS: Two small trials reported changes in these blood lipids at one to two years. GRADE assessment suggests that the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets that include a weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phase compared to balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets that include a weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phase on change in LDL at one to two years in overweight and obese participants without T2DM (very low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias and twice for imprecision). RESULTS: One trial used a weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phase of 12 weeks followed by a maintenance phase of 40 weeks, and the other trial used a weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phase of six months followed by a maintenance phase of 18 months with changes reported at one and two years, respectively for LDL cholesterol (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00900.08 mmol/L, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00900.44 to 0.28, I2 = 0%, 56 participants, 2 RCTs, very low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 2.4), HDL cholesterol (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00900.05 mmol/L, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00900.37 to 0.28, I2 = 5%, 56 participants, 2 RCTs,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 2.5), total cholesterol (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00900.08 mmol/L, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00900.43 to 0.27, I2 = 0%, 56 participants, 2 RCTs,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 2.6) and triglycerides (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00900.08 mmol/L, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00900.34 to 0.17, I2 = 0%, 56 participants, 2 RCTs,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 2.7).\u00c2 RESULTS: Average LDL cholesterol reductions from baseline ranged from 0.79 mmol/L to 0.2 mmol/L with low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets and from 1.15 mmol/L to 0.14 mmol/L with balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets. For HDL\u00e2\u0080\u0090cholesterol, average changes ranged from a decrease of 0.2 mmol/L to an increase of 0.11 mmol/L with low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets and from increases of 0.03 mmol/L to 0.04 mmol/L with balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets. Average reductions in total cholesterol ranged from 0.24 mmol/L to 0.79 mmol/L with low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets and from 0.17 mmol/L to 1.14 mmol/L with balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets. For triglycerides, average reductions ranged from 0.19 mmol/L to 0.28 mmol/L with low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets and from 0.04 mmol/L to 0.13 mmol/L with balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets.

Low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets versus balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets in overweight and obese participants with T2DM (weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090loss phase only) RESULTS: Table 3\u00c2\u00a0presents the effects of low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets compared to balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets (weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phase only) in overweight and obese participants with T2DM on short\u00e2\u0080\u0090term (three to < 12 months) and long\u00e2\u0080\u0090term (\u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months) changes in body weight, as well as on the number of participants per group with weight loss of at least 5% over the long term, long\u00e2\u0080\u0090term change in DBP, HbA1c and LDL cholesterol, and short\u00e2\u0080\u0090term constipation. RESULTS: Key details about studies in this comparison, including characteristics of the intervention, population, outcomes and method of synthesis can be found in the OSIS table (Table 10). RESULTS: Primary outcomes RESULTS: Change in body weight (kg) at three to < 12 months RESULTS: GRADE assessment suggests that low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets probably result in little to no difference in change in body weight over three to six months compared to balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets in overweight and obese participants with T2DM (moderate\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias). RESULTS: Average weight reductions from baseline over three to six months ranged from 12 kg to 2.41 kg with low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets and from 11.5 kg to 0.33 kg with balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets in the 14 trials reporting this outcome. The meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis showed little to no difference in weight reduction on average between low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate and balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diet groups over three to six months (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00901.26 kg, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00902.44 to \u00e2\u0080\u00900.09, I2 = 47%, 1114 participants, 14 RCTs,\u00c2\u00a0moderate\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 3.1). This lack of a difference in effect was also seen with sensitivity analyses including only trials with 'some concerns' of bias overall (Analysis 3.2, no trials at overall low risk of bias), at low risk of attrition bias (Analysis 3.3) and without reported diet/food industry funding (Analysis 3.4).\u00c2 RESULTS: One included trial also measured change in body weight at three to < 12 months but reported it in an unusable format (Table 9). The funnel plot (Figure 5) suggests that smaller studies may be missing. The mean difference in fixed\u00e2\u0080\u0090effect analysis, which gives less weight to small studies (\u00e2\u0080\u00900.92 kg, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00901.65 to \u00e2\u0080\u00900.19), is similar to the mean difference in random\u00e2\u0080\u0090effects meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis (\u00e2\u0080\u00901.26 kg, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00902.44 to \u00e2\u0080\u00900.09,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 3.1), which gives more weight to smaller studies, suggesting that any small\u00e2\u0080\u0090study effects have little effect on the intervention effect estimate. FIG: Funnel plot for change in weight at 3 to < 12 months (Analysis 3.1) in comparison 3 RESULTS: Four of the 14 trials had follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up at three months from baseline, one trial at four months and nine at six months.\u00c2 RESULTS: Change in body weight (kg) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months RESULTS: GRADE assessment suggests that low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets probably result in little to no difference in change in body weight over one to two years compared to balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets in overweight and obese participants with T2DM (moderate\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias). RESULTS: Average weight reductions from baseline over one to two years in the seven trials reporting this outcome ranged from 8.9 kg to 2 kg with low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets and from 7.4 kg to 1.7 kg with balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets. The meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis showed little to no difference in weight reduction on average between low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate and balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diet groups over one to two years (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00900.33 kg, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00902.13 to 1.46, I2 = 10%, 813 participants, 7 RCTs,\u00c2\u00a0moderate\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 3.5). This lack of a difference in effect was also seen with the sensitivity analysis including only trials\u00c2\u00a0without diet/food industry funding (Analysis 3.6). Other planned sensitivity analyses included only one or two studies and thus were not performed.\u00c2 RESULTS: Of the seven trials, four had follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up at one year and three had follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up at two years. The oldest included trial also measured change in body weight at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months but reported it in an unusable format (Table 9).\u00c2 RESULTS: Number of participants per group with weight loss of at least 5% at three to < 12 months RESULTS: A single small study reported on this outcome at three months and the risk ratio was 1.01 (95% CI 0.77 to 1.33, 45 participants, 1 RCT,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 3.7) with 19 participants in the low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate group and 18 participants in the balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate group achieving at least 5% weight loss from baseline. RESULTS: Number of participants per group with weight loss of at least 5% at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months RESULTS: GRADE assessment suggests that the evidence is very uncertain about whether there is a difference in the number of participants per group with weight loss of at least 5% at one to two years, when comparing low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets with balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets in overweight and obese participants with T2DM (very low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias, once for indirectness and twice for imprecision). RESULTS: Two studies reported on this outcome at one and two years (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.20; I\u00c2\u00b2 = 0; 106 participants, 2 RCTs,\u00c2\u00a0very low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence,\u00c2\u00a0) with the number of participants achieving at least 5% weight loss from baseline ranging from 10 to 22 in the low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing group and 14 to 20 in the balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing group.\u00c2 RESULTS: Secondary outcomes RESULTS: For comparison 3, no studies reported on the number of participants per group with reduction in BMI (kg/m2) of at least 5%. RESULTS: Change in BMI (kg/m2) at three to < 12 months RESULTS: Eleven trials (n = 515 participants) reported on short\u00e2\u0080\u0090term BMI change. Across these trials, average reductions in BMI from baseline ranged from 4 kg/m2 to 0.87 kg/m2 with low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets and from 4 kg/m2 to 0.1 kg/m2 with balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets. We did not pool these results into an overall effect estimate due to substantial heterogeneity (I\u00c2\u00b2 = 57%, Tau\u00c2\u00b2 = 0.56; Chi\u00c2\u00b2 = 23.11, df = 10 (P = 0.01)) but rather presented the individual effect sizes between the two types of diet per study (Analysis 3.9). Three of the 10 trials had follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up at three months, one at four months and seven at six months. RESULTS: Change in BMI (kg/m2) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months RESULTS: Average reductions in BMI from baseline over the long term in the four trials reporting this outcome ranged from 3.3 kg/m2 to 0.8 kg/m2 with low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets and from 2.6 kg/m2 to 0.9 kg/m2 with balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets.\u00c2\u00a0When low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets were compared to balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets, the difference in BMI change on average at one to two years was \u00e2\u0080\u00900.29 kg/m2 (95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00901.06 to 0.48, I2 = 13%, 329 participants, 4 RCTs,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 3.10). Two trials had follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up at one year and the remaining two at two years. RESULTS: Change in DBP (mmHg) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months RESULTS: GRADE assessment suggests that low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets probably result in little to no difference to change in DBP compared to balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets over one to two years in overweight and obese participants with T2DM (moderate\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias). RESULTS: Over one to two years, average changes from baseline in DBP ranged from a reduction of 5 mmHg to an increase 3 mmHg in low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diet groups and from a reduction of 6 mmHg to an increase of 4.3 mmHg in balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diet groups across the six trials reporting on this outcome. The meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis of the mean difference in change in DBP between the low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate and balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets demonstrated little to no difference at one to two years (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00900.28 mmHg 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00901.84 to 1.28, I2 = 0%, 631 participants, 6 RCTs, moderate\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 3.11). Three of the six trials had follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up at one year and the other three at two years. RESULTS: Change in SBP (mmHg) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months RESULTS: Average change in SBP from baseline in the six trials reporting this outcome ranged from a reduction of 9 mmHg to an increase of 3.2 mmHg with low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets and from a reduction of 11 mmHg to an increase of 2.4 mmHg with balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets over one to two years of follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up. The mean difference in change in SBP at one to two years was 0.32 mmHg (95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00902.30 to 2.93, I2 = 0%, 629 participants, 6 RCTs,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 3.12). Three of the six trials had follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up at one year and the other three at two years. RESULTS: Change in HbA1c (%) at 12 months RESULTS: GRADE assessment suggests that low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets probably result in little to no difference to change in HbA1c compared to balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets over one to two years in overweight and obese participants with T2DM (moderate\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias). RESULTS: Average change in HbA1c from baseline over one to two years ranged from a reduction of 2% to an increase of 0.1% with low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets and from a reduction of 1.8% to an increase of 0.2% with balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets across the six trials that reported this outcome.

Four of the six trials had follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up at one year and the other two had follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up at two years. One included trial also measured change in HbA1c in diabetic participants only at one year but reported it in an unusable format (Table 9). RESULTS: Change in LDL cholesterol (mmol/L) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months RESULTS: GRADE assessment suggests that low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets probably result in little to no difference in change in LDL\u00e2\u0080\u0090cholesterol over one to two years compared to balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets in overweight and obese participants with T2DM (moderate\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias). RESULTS: Average change from baseline over one to two years across the seven trials reporting on change in LDL cholesterol ranged from a reduction of 0.61 mmol/L to an increase of 0.2 mmol/L in low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diet groups and from a reduction of 0.55 mmol/L to an increase of 0.1 mmol/L in balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diet groups.

One included trial also measured constipation at three months but reported data in an unusable format (Table 9). RESULTS: One trial reported constipation at one year (RR 2.71, 95% CI 0.11 to 64.65, 78 participants, 1 RCT,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 3.20). RESULTS: One trial reported on events of diarrhoea at six months (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.84, 84 participants, 1 RCT,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 3.21). Another trial (using an adaption of the Health Symptom Checklist) (Saslow 2017a) reported \"no statistically significant changes\" for diarrhoea at three months (data were not reported or provided when authors were contacted), and also reported heartburn symptoms at three months (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00900.30, 95% CI\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00900.66 to 0.06, 33 participants, 1 RCT,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 3.22).

Another trial reported no statistical difference between participants in the low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diet group and the balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090diet group for headaches at three months (used adaptation of the Health Symptom Checklist), but data were not reported or provided when authors were contacted (Saslow 2017a). RESULTS: Psychosocial problems (mood disturbances) RESULTS: \u00c2\u00a0At three months follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up, one trial reported depressive symptoms according to the 20\u00e2\u0080\u0090item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES\u00e2\u0080\u0090D) (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00900.20, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00909.20 to 8.80, 33 participants, 1 RCT,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 3.25). RESULTS: Comparison 4. Low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets versus balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets in overweight and obese participants with T2DM (weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phase followed by weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phase) RESULTS: Table 4\u00c2\u00a0presents the effects of low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets compared to balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets (weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phase followed by weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phase) in overweight and obese participants with T2DM on short\u00e2\u0080\u0090term (three to <12 months) and long\u00e2\u0080\u0090term (\u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months) changes in body weight, DBP, HbA1c and LDL cholesterol, and short\u00e2\u0080\u0090term constipation. RESULTS: Key details about studies in this comparison, including characteristics of the intervention, population, outcomes and method of synthesis are detailed in the OSIS table (Table 10). RESULTS: Primary outcomes RESULTS: The only primary outcomes reported by the included trials for comparison 4 were change in body weight at three to < 12 months and change in body weight at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months.\u00c2 RESULTS: Change in body weight (kg) at three to < 12 months RESULTS: GRADE assessment suggests that low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets that include a weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phase may result in little to no difference in change in body weight at six months compared to balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets that include a weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phase in overweight and obese participants with T2DM (low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias and once for imprecision). RESULTS: The single study reporting change in weight at six months found average weight reductions of 1 kg with the low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diet and 0.2 kg with the balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diet. The mean difference in weight reduction between the two diets in this study demonstrated little to no difference at six months (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00900.80 kg, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00902.46 to 0.86, 61 participants, 1 RCT,\u00c2\u00a0low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 4.1). This trial tested diets with a three\u00e2\u0080\u0090month weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phase followed by a three\u00e2\u0080\u0090month weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phase. RESULTS: Change in body weight (kg) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months RESULTS: GRADE assessment suggests that low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets that include a weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phase may result in little to no difference in change in body weight over one to two years compared to balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets that include a weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phase in overweight and obese participants with T2DM (low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias and once for imprecision). RESULTS: Average changes in weight from baseline over one to two years in the three trials reporting this outcome ranged from a reduction of 2.23 kg to an increase 1.3 kg with low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets and from reductions of 2.17 kg to 1.5 kg with balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets. The meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis of the mean difference in weight reduction between the low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate and balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets demonstrated little to no difference at one to two years (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00900.07 kg, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00901.31 to 1.17, I\u00c2\u00b2 = 0%, 158 participants, 3 RCTs,\u00c2\u00a0low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 4.2). The shortest of the trials measured change in weight at one year with the diets having a three\u00e2\u0080\u0090month weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090loss phase followed by a nine\u00e2\u0080\u0090month weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phase. The second trial had follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up at 18 months and tested diets with a six\u00e2\u0080\u0090month weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phase followed by a 12\u00e2\u0080\u0090month maintenance phase. The third trial had follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up at two years, and tested diets with a three\u00e2\u0080\u0090month weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing followed by a 21\u00e2\u0080\u0090month weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phase. All trials had high risk of attrition bias and overall bias, and had diet/food industry funding, precluding sensitivity analyses.\u00c2 RESULTS: Secondary outcomes RESULTS: The secondary outcomes reported by the included trials for comparison 4 were change in BMI at three to < 12 months, change in BMI at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months, change in HbA1c, DBP, SBP, LDL and HDL cholesterol, total cholesterol and triglycerides. \u00c2 RESULTS: Change in BMI (kg/m2) at three to < 12 months RESULTS: One trial compared these diets using a three\u00e2\u0080\u0090month weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phase followed by a three\u00e2\u0080\u0090month weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phase and reported average BMI reductions from baseline of 0.3 kg/m2 in the low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate group and 0.01 kg/m2 in the balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate group after six months. The meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis of the mean difference in BMI change at six months was \u00e2\u0080\u00900.29 kg/m2 (95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00900.83 to 0.25, 61 participants, 1 RCT,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 4.3).\u00c2 RESULTS: Change in BMI (kg/m2) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months RESULTS: The single trial reporting on this outcome in comparison 4 found average BMI reductions from baseline of 0.75 kg/m2 with the low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diet and 0.63 kg/m2 with the balanced diet after 18 months (six\u00e2\u0080\u0090month weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phase followed by 12\u00e2\u0080\u0090month weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phase). The mean difference in BMI change at 18 months in this trial was \u00e2\u0080\u00900.12 kg/m2 (95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00900.86 to 0.62, 47 participants, 1 RCT,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 4.4). RESULTS: Changes in DBP and SBP (mmHg) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months RESULTS: GRADE assessment suggests that the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets that include a weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phase compared to balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets that include a weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phase on change in DBP at one year in overweight and obese participants with T2DM (very low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias and twice for imprecision). RESULTS: One trial compared these diets in comparison 4 using a three\u00e2\u0080\u0090month weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phase followed by a nine\u00e2\u0080\u0090month maintenance phase, and reported on changes in DBP (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00900.44 mmHg, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00904.89 to 4.01, 99 participants, 1 RCT,\u00c2\u00a0very low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 4.5) and SBP\u00c2\u00a0(MD \u00e2\u0080\u00904.27 mmHg, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00908.74 to 0.20, 99 participants, 1 RCT,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 4.6) at one year. The study reported average DBP increases from a baseline of 0.21 mmHg in the low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diet group and of 0.65 mmHg in the balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diet group at one year. For SBP, the study reported an average decrease from baseline of 5.03 mmHg in the low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate group and 0.76 mmHg in the balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate group. RESULTS: Change in HbA1c (%) at 12 months RESULTS: GRADE assessment suggests that low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets that include a weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phase may result in little to no difference in change in HbA1c over one to two years compared to balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets that include a weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phase in overweight and obese participants with T2DM (low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias and once for imprecision). RESULTS: Average changes in HbA1c from baseline over one to two years in the three trials reporting this outcome ranged from a reduction of 0.39% to an increase of 0.3% with low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets and from a reduction of 0.37% to an increase of 0.4% with balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets. The meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis of the mean difference in change in HbA1c between the low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate and balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets demonstrated little to no difference at one to two years (MD 0.02%, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00900.30 to 0.33, I\u00c2\u00b2 = 0%, 160 participants, 3 RCTs,\u00c2\u00a0low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 4.7). The shortest of the trials measured change in HbA1c at one year with diets having a three\u00e2\u0080\u0090month weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090loss phase followed by a nine\u00e2\u0080\u0090month weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phase. The second trial had follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up at 18 months and tested diets with a six\u00e2\u0080\u0090month weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phase followed by a 12\u00e2\u0080\u0090month maintenance phase. The third trial had follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up at two years, and tested diets with a three\u00e2\u0080\u0090month weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing followed by a 21\u00e2\u0080\u0090month weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phase. RESULTS: Change in LDL, HDL and total cholesterol and triglycerides (mmol/L) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months RESULTS: Two trials reported changes in these blood lipids at one to two years. GRADE assessment suggests that low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets that include a weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phase may result in little to no difference in change in LDL over one year to 18 months compared to balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets that include a weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phase in overweight and obese participants with T2DM (low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias and once for imprecision). RESULTS: One trial had follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up at one year with diets having a three\u00e2\u0080\u0090month weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090loss phase followed by a nine\u00e2\u0080\u0090month weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phase. The other trial assessed follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up at 18 months and tested diets with a six\u00e2\u0080\u0090month weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phase followed by a 12\u00e2\u0080\u0090month maintenance phase.\u00c2\u00a0The meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis of the mean difference in change in LDL cholesterol between the low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate and balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets demonstrated little to no difference at one year to 18 months (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00900.06 mmol/L, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00900.26 to 0.13, I\u00c2\u00b2 = 0%, 145 participants, 2 RCTs,\u00c2\u00a0low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 4.8). The two trials reported on HDL cholesterol (MD 0.0 mmol/L, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00900.07 to 0.08, I\u00c2\u00b2 = 0%, 148 participants, 2 RCTs,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 4.9) and triglycerides (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00900.06 mmol/L, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00900.45 to 0.32, I\u00c2\u00b2 = 0%, 148 participants, 2 RCTs,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 4.11), while only one of the trials reported on total cholesterol at one year (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00900.16 mmol/L, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00900.51 to 0.19, 99 participants, 1 RCT,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 4.10).\u00c2 RESULTS: Average changes in LDL cholesterol over one year to 18 months in the two trials ranged from reductions of 0.2 mmol/L to 0.05 mmol/L with low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets and from a reduction of 0.17 mmol/L to an increase of 0.04 mmol/L with balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets. For HDL cholesterol, average increases over this period ranged from 0.04 mmol/L to 0.08 mmol/L with low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets and from 0.03 mmol/L to 0.08 mmol/L with balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets. Average changes in total cholesterol at one year reported by the single study ranged from a reduction of 0.15 mmol/L in the low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate group to an increase of 0.01 mmol/L in the balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate group. For triglycerides, average changes over one year to 18 months in the two trials ranged from a reduction of 0.47 mmol/L to an increase of 0.07 mmol/L with low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets and from reductions of 0.3 mmol/L to 0.05 mmol/L with balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets. RESULTS: Participant\u00e2\u0080\u0090reported adverse effects\u00c2 RESULTS: Two adverse effects were reported by a single trial in comparison 4 (Watson 2016). This trial reported on anxiety at six months using the 'Anxiety and worry' subscale of the D\u00e2\u0080\u009039 diabetes QoL questionnaire, but did not report sample sizes per group. The mean score in the low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diet group was 33.91 (SE 3.55) and in the balanced diet group was 31.43 (SE 3.71). Fatigue at six months was also reported on by this trial using the 'Energy and mobility' subscale of the D\u00e2\u0080\u009039 diabetes QoL questionnaire. The mean score in the low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diet group was 22.04 (SE 2.49) and in the balanced diet group was 23.28 (SE 2.61), with no sample sizes being reported per group. DISCUSS: Discussion DISCUSS: Summary of main results DISCUSS: This review examined the effects of low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets compared to 'balanced'\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets on weight and cardiovascular risk factors. We used approaches aimed at addressing factors that may limit interpretation in other similar reviews. These included explicit criteria for the compositions and intentions of the treatment and control diets, stratifying findings in participants without and with T2DM, separating findings from weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing and weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phases of diets, meaningful and comparable follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up periods, comprehensive searches, and multiple efforts to obtain and include all relevant and necessary data and information not reported in published papers; as well as assessing the certainty of this evidence using GRADE. To our knowledge, this review includes the largest number of trials that have examined this question to date. DISCUSS: Low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets compared to balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets (weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phases only) DISCUSS: Participants without and with T2DM in both low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate and balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diet groups reduced their weight to varying degrees in the short term (range of weight reduction across both diets: 12.2 to 0.33 kg) and long term (range of weight reduction across both diets: 13.1 to 1.7 kg). We considered a loss of at least 5% of initial weight to be clinically meaningful, and a weight change that could reasonably be expected in our minimum diet duration of 12 weeks. Thus, reductions from around the middle of these ranges (about 4 to 6 kg in most trials) would start to become clinically meaningful and translate to improvements in cardio metabolic health (Brown 2016;\u00c2\u00a0Franz 2015;\u00c2\u00a0Jensen 2014;\u00c2\u00a0Truby 2006;\u00c2\u00a0Wald 2012;\u00c2\u00a0Wing 2010).\u00c2 DISCUSS: Notably, in overweight and obese participants without and with T2DM, the meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analyses showed little or no difference between the effects of low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets and balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets on weight reduction over three to 8.5 months (short term), with mean differences in weight reduction of about one kilogram. This was also the case over one to two years (long term), with mean differences in weight reduction of less than one kilogram. The 95% CIs of pooled mean differences in short\u00e2\u0080\u0090 and long\u00e2\u0080\u0090term weight change did not include appreciable harm or benefit (ranging from 2.44 kg lower to 1.46 kg higher), and we therefore did not downgrade for imprecision. The lack of differences found in effects on weight reduction were confirmed by sensitivity analyses. There was, however, some heterogeneity in effects in participants without T2DM over the short term. Subgrouping by similarity of energy prescription, extent of carbohydrate restriction, diagnosed cardiovascular event or disease at baseline or gender did not suggest important clinical differences in average effects between the various subgroups. Mean differences in weight reduction between diet groups across the various subgroups at the short term ranged between 0.25 kg and 2.71 kg. Some heterogeneity could be explained by subgrouping studies according to similarity of energy prescription and extent of carbohydrate restriction.\u00c2 DISCUSS: We do not know whether there is a difference in the number of participants per group with weight loss of at least 5% at the long term since only one trial (n = 68) in men, judged as being at high risk of bias, reported on this outcome. DISCUSS: For mean changes in DBP at one to two years, some trials reported reductions and other trials reported increases in both diet groups in participants without and with T2DM (range of mean change across diet groups: \u00e2\u0080\u009011 to 4.3 mmHg). In all participants, meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analyses showed little or no difference between the effects of the two diets on changes in DBP at one to two years, with mean differences of less than 0.5 mmHg. The 95% CIs of these pooled mean differences did not include appreciable harm or benefit (ranging from 1.84 mmHg lower to 1.28 mmHg higher) and we did not downgrade for imprecision. We considered changes in DBP of greater than 2 mmHg to be clinically meaningful (Whelton 2002). DISCUSS: At one to two years in both diet groups, some trials reported reductions in LDL cholesterol and others reported increases in participants without and with T2DM (range of mean change across diet groups: \u00e2\u0080\u00900.61 to 0.6 mmol/L). Meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analyses showed little or no difference between the effects of the two diets on changes in LDL cholesterol at one to two years in all participants, with mean differences of up to 0.1 mmol/L. The 95% CIs of these pooled mean differences did not include appreciable harm or benefit (ranging from 0.05 mmol/L lower to 0.26 mmol/L higher) and we did not downgrade for imprecision. We considered changes in LDL cholesterol of greater than 0.26 mmol/L to be clinically meaningful (Fernandez\u00e2\u0080\u0090Friera\u00c2\u00a02017;\u00c2\u00a0Howard 2000). DISCUSS: At one to two years, some trials in participants with T2DM reported reductions in HbA1c and others reported small increases in HbA1c in both diet groups (range of change across diet groups: \u00e2\u0080\u00902% to 0.2%). Pooling these mean differences found little or no difference between the effects of low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets versus balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets on change in HbA1c over one to two years in overweight and obese participants with T2DM, with a mean difference of 0.14%. The 95% CI of the pooled mean difference did not include appreciable harm or benefit (0.38% lower to 0.1% higher) and we did not downgrade for imprecision. We considered changes in HbA1c of greater than 0.5% to be clinically meaningful (NICE 2015). DISCUSS: Participant\u00e2\u0080\u0090reported adverse effects were poorly reported. In the few trials where these were reported, the effects included constipation, which we regarded as a patient\u00e2\u0080\u0090important adverse effect since it is frequently reported by people following low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets. These limited data mean that we are very uncertain about whether there is a difference in the number of participants per diet group with constipation at three to six months in all participants. DISCUSS: Low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets compared to balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets (weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phase followed by weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phase) DISCUSS: Evidence about the comparative effects of diets from studies using weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phases followed by weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phases was limited. Only eight trials reported these data for some outcomes, and one of these trials did not contribute any numeric data to meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analyses. All the trials applied different approaches and time frames to the weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phases of the diets, with the shortest weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phase being six weeks and the longest being 21 months. Findings were similar to the comparisons that included only weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phases of the two diets, but our certainty in these findings was lower, largely due to imprecision, with small total sample sizes and wide 95% CIs around the pooled estimates.\u00c2 DISCUSS: In overweight and obese participants without T2DM, meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analyses showed that low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets including a weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phase may result in little or no difference in change in weight over one to two years compared to balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets including a weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phase. We are very uncertain about whether there are differences in effects on DBP and LDL cholesterol between the two diets in these participants. None of the eight trials reported usable data for the other outcomes in our summary of findings table.\u00c2 DISCUSS: In overweight and obese participants with T2DM, meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analyses showed that low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets including a weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phase may result in little or no difference in change in weight at six months, and at one to two years, compared to balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets including a weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phase. This was also the case for change in HbA1c and LDL cholesterol. We are very uncertain about whether there are differences in effects on DBP between the two diets in these participants. None of the eight trials reported usable data for the other outcomes in our summary of findings table. DISCUSS: Overall completeness and applicability of evidence DISCUSS: Our review employed a comprehensive search strategy with no language restrictions to identify all RCTs assessing the effects of low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets on weight and cardiovascular risk in overweight and obese adults without or with T2DM. We tapped multiple sources of information for all trials and contacted study authors multiple times in all cases where we needed additional data or information. This included requesting information from 30 author teams to enable clear judgements and reporting related to eligibility, stratification, risk of bias, as well as numeric data to enable the inclusion of as much usable data in meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analyses as we could obtain.\u00c2 DISCUSS: We prespecified outcomes at defined lengths of follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up to examine possible differences in effects over time. No trials reported on outcomes after two years, and 60% of trials had a duration of six months or less. Change in body weight was reported by most trials, but few studies trials reported on the number of participants per group with weight loss of at least 5% from baseline. Despite multiple attempts, we were not unable to obtain and include weight change data from 11 trials, as they reported data in unusable formats.\u00c2 DISCUSS: None of the trials reported on all\u00e2\u0080\u0090cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, non\u00e2\u0080\u0090fatal myocardial infarction, non\u00e2\u0080\u0090fatal stroke and diagnosis of T2DM. This is to be expected\u00c2\u00a0to some degree in view of the practical challenges posed by long durations of follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up in weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diet trials.\u00c2\u00a0Pooled data from long\u00e2\u0080\u0090term prospective cohort studies on dietary carbohydrate intake and mortality have demonstrated harm at the extremes of intake (Seidelmann 2018). Moreover, a range of potential shorter\u00e2\u0080\u0090 and longer\u00e2\u0080\u0090term safety concerns of low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets have been discussed in recent papers, such as reduced dietary intake of fibre, minerals, vitamins, trace elements and polyunsaturated fats, unknown effects of long\u00e2\u0080\u0090term ketosis, harmful environmental impacts and dysbiosis (Barber 2021;\u00c2\u00a0Sievenpiper 2020).\u00c2 DISCUSS: The effect of weight reduction per se on cardiovascular risk factors is also important for interpreting this evidence, as it is known that a weight reduction of 5% or more is associated with improvements in cardio metabolic risks, including blood lipids, blood pressure and HbA1c (Brown 2016;\u00c2\u00a0Franz 2015). As we found little to no difference in weight reduction between low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate and balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets up to two years, one would reasonably not expect to find meaningful differences in effects on blood lipids, blood pressure and HbA1c between the two diets, which was the case in our review. DISCUSS: Our review did not seek to address effects of differences in the quality of dietary carbohydrates, or the quality of the replacement macronutrients (e.g. fat). Both quality and quantity or proportions are vital components of understanding the effects of macronutrients on health outcomes (Abdelhamid 2018;\u00c2\u00a0Barber 2021;\u00c2\u00a0Hooper 2020;\u00c2\u00a0Reynolds 2019;\u00c2\u00a0Sievenpiper 2020).\u00c2 DISCUSS: A criticism of examining mean differences in weight between diet groups is that they do not fully account for true different individual responses, where \u00e2\u0080\u0098true\u00e2\u0080\u0099 refers to individual response differences that are not a result of random trial\u00e2\u0080\u0090to\u00e2\u0080\u0090trial variability. In the context of 'personalised' nutrition, there is interest in ascertaining whether there are true individual differences in the responses to weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets large enough to be clinically relevant. A recent systematic review, using a response variance comparison approach, examined whether the weight responses to low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets or low\u00e2\u0080\u0090fat diets (typically, balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets) differ between individuals, and was unable to detect clinically relevant differences in individual response heterogeneity between the two diets (Smith 2020). DISCUSS: All except one of the 61 trials were conducted in high\u00e2\u0080\u0090income countries. There are, however, no obvious reasons to expect the effects of low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets on body weight to be different in people from low\u00e2\u0080\u0090 and middle\u00e2\u0080\u0090income countries. High costs of low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets and disproportionate financial effects on lower socioeconomic groups, which are beyond the scope of our review, have been covered elsewhere (Barber 2021;\u00c2\u00a0Raffensperger 2008). DISCUSS: Nearly 40% of included trials reported some or all funding by food/diet industry and related private companies, such as food and nutrition product manufacturers, organisations representing the interests of food producers (e.g. Pork Council, Dairy Farmers Association) and diet book and diet product organisations. DISCUSS: There are many individual and environmental factors that influence a person's ability to adhere to weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets, and studies have shown that adherence to weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets is one of the major factors that determine success over the short and long term (Gibson 2017). Systematic reviews and RCTs of low\u00e2\u0080\u0090 and balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets have demonstrated that adherence is a problem, and reduces over time with both diets, with some of these specifically reporting difficulty with adhering to severely carbohydrate\u00e2\u0080\u0090restricted diets over the long term (Foster 2003;\u00c2\u00a0Gibson 2017;\u00c2\u00a0Ross 2021;\u00c2\u00a0Sacks 2009). We did not investigate the possible influence of adherence on the effects of the dietary interventions. However, we did extract information on fidelity for both diets (Characteristics of included studies), i.e. the degree to which an intervention happened in the way the investigators intended it to (Hoffman 2014).\u00c2 DISCUSS: Quality of the evidence DISCUSS: The interpretation of most weight reduction trials is constrained by small samples, a lack of blinding, and large loss to follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up (Simons\u00e2\u0080\u0090Morton 2006), which were also observed across the trials in our review. None of the trials in the review were judged as having low risk of bias overall. The overall risk of bias of outcomes across trials in participants without and with T2DM was predominantly high, largely due to high proportions of missing outcome data in many trials. DISCUSS: Potential biases in the review process DISCUSS: The review may be affected by non\u00e2\u0080\u0090reporting bias. For the 'known unknowns' (particular results from a trial not reported in a usable format), we contacted trial authors multiple times to obtain the data in a usable format. Failure to obtain this and consequent exclusion thereof is a limitation of the review process, as we cannot be absolutely certain if and how the inclusion of these data would have affected the pooled estimates. However, given the agreement in pooled mean differences in weight reduction between our review and other similar reviews, we think it is unlikely that these data would have meaningfully changed our pooled estimates. It was harder to make a judgement about the 'unknown unknowns' (entire eligible trials not reported or picked up by our comprehensive searching), but it is possible that small unpublished trials are missing. Interpreting funnel plot asymmetry was challenging since many trials had similar standard errors.\u00c2 DISCUSS: We excluded RCTs of less than 12 weeks' duration which may have been relevant to the review question. The reason for choosing only trials with at least 12 weeks follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up was to allow sufficient time to detect clinically meaningful weight and cardiovascular risk factor changes.\u00c2 DISCUSS: Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews DISCUSS: Pooled mean differences in weight reduction and cardiovascular risk factors in our review are in line with a number of recent systematic reviews with pairwise meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analyses (Chawla 2020;\u00c2\u00a0Dong 2020;\u00c2\u00a0Smith 2020;\u00c2\u00a0Yang 2021), and an older review with network meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analyses (Johnston 2014), in participants without T2DM. This is also the case for recent similar reviews in participants with T2DM (Meng 2017;\u00c2\u00a0Silverii 2020;\u00c2\u00a0Snorgaard 2017;\u00c2\u00a0Van Zuuren 2018). Systematic reviews with varying definitions of low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets and differing eligibility criteria have shown that low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets do not result in superior long\u00e2\u0080\u0090term clinically meaningful weight reduction. An overview of systematic reviews\u00c2\u00a0of RCTs comparing low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate to control diets (low\u00e2\u0080\u0090fat or energy\u00e2\u0080\u0090restricted) in adults with overweight and obesity included\u00c2\u00a012 reviews (10 with meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analyses) and reported an inverse relationship between number of trial participants and the size of differences in weight loss (Churuangsuk 2018). CONCL: Authors' conclusions CONCL: Implications for practice CONCL: The small pooled mean differences in weight reduction between the diets (about 1 to 2 kg), while statistically significant in the short term, were not clinically important in the short or long term in an overweight and obese adult, without or with T2DM (low\u00e2\u0080\u0090to moderate\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence). These differences are similar to typical ranges of biological weight fluctuations over time (Liska 2019;\u00c2\u00a0Vuorinen 2021), and can at least in part be ascribed to biological weight fluctuations, which are influenced by various factors including level of activity, hydration status, season and medications. When interpreting the sizes of the mean differences of weight reduction between the two diets, one should also consider the total body water loss (2 to 3 kg) that follows dietary carbohydrate restriction due to diet\u00e2\u0080\u0090induced diuresis from glycogen depletion and production of ketone bodies, which is restored when carbohydrates are eaten again (Denke 2001;\u00c2\u00a0Yang 1976).\u00c2 CONCL: Our systematic review failed to show that low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets are superior to balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets, with little or no difference in weight reduction and cardiovascular risk factors over the short (three to 8.5 months) and long term (one to two years). Trials did not report on our prespecified outcomes after two years of follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up. The range of potential safety concerns of low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets not addressed in this review over the short and longer term should also be considered.\u00c2 CONCL: Most trials included participants without diagnosed cardiovascular disease or events at baseline, and average baseline LDL cholesterol concentrations and DBP across the trials were within the normal ranges defined for people without coronary artery disease. In people with lipid disorders and variability with atherogenic lipoprotein response, caution in recommending low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate and consequent high\u00e2\u0080\u0090fat diets is warranted. Evidence on participant\u00e2\u0080\u0090reported adverse effects over two years was limited and we could not draw any conclusions about these. CONCL: Dietary modification is central to weight reduction, however, in view of the complex aetiology of obesity, it is important to consider the demonstrated value of combining diet and other positive lifestyle and behavioural interventions to reduce weight and cardiovascular risk. Current dietary guidance allows for flexibility in the proportion of macronutrients, including a wide range of carbohydrate intakes, with greater emphasis on quality over quantity and on total dietary patterns over single nutrients.\u00c2 CONCL: Implications for research CONCL: In view of the challenges associated with weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diet trials and the similar findings from this and other comparable reviews, it could reasonably be argued that additional trials on this question are not needed. However, the effects of low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets compared to balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets beyond two years is unknown. If conducted, future trials on this question in participants without and with T2DM, should be longer than two years, adequately powered with greater attention to methodological quality, and specifically the use of more appropriate and rigorous statistical approaches to address loss to follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up, where relevant. Prospective registration, publication of protocols and of detailed data analysis plans, as well as use of appropriate reporting guidelines (e.g. CONSORT) by future trials, would also be beneficial to the quality and utility of any future research. Other key research areas related to dietary interventions for weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reduction and cardiovascular health include improving dietary adherence, which is critical to both short\u00e2\u0080\u0090 and long\u00e2\u0080\u0090term weight loss, total dietary patterns and macronutrient quality.\u00c2 CONCL: History CONCL: Protocol first published: Issue 5, 2019 CONCL: Risk of bias TABLE: Risk of bias for analysis 1.1 Change in body weight (kg) at 3 to < 12 months TABLE: Study\tBias\t \tRandomisation process\tDeviations from intended interventions\tMissing outcome data\tMeasurement of the outcome\tSelection of the reported results\tOverall\t \tAuthors' judgement\tSupport for judgement\tAuthors' judgement\tSupport for judgement\tAuthors' judgement\tSupport for judgement\tAuthors' judgement\tSupport for judgement\tAuthors' judgement\tSupport for judgement\tAuthors' judgement\tSupport for judgement\t \tAude 2004\tSome concerns\tRandomisation was done using a block design by sex to achieve an equal sex distribution.

The private session and telephone calls were digitally recorded, such that the study director and lead dietitian could monitor deviations from the protocol and provide feedback to dietitians as necessary. The duration of the private session and each telephone call also was monitored as an indicator of integrity with regard to treatment intensity. Third, weekly staff meetings provided an opportunity for continued discussion on intervention delivery, particularly strategies for assisting individual participants without compromising differentiation between diets. Fourth, dietitians were given detailed guidelines for providing written feedback on food diaries to avoid unintended overlap in dietary advice between groups. Participant adherence was evaluated based on attendance at group workshops and private sessions, completion of motivational telephone called and self\u00e2\u0080\u0090reported dietary intake. In addition, data were obtained in regard to physical activity and participant satisfaction with program.\"Extent of intervention fidelity: For the low\u00e2\u0080\u0090fat group, total fat intake decreased (mean [SE], \u00e2\u0080\u009310.8% [1.3%] of energy; P = 0.001), as did saturated fat intake (mean [SE],\u00e2\u0080\u00934.5% [0.6%] of energy; P = 0.001). Carbohydrate intake increased, producing an increase in glycemic load (mean [SE], 5.0 [2.5] g/1000 kcal; P = 0.05) even though glycemic index decreased slightly. Treatment intensity did not differ between diet groups (P > 0.40). On average, participants attended a mean (SE) of 13.4 (0.7) of the 23 scheduled workshops and completed 5.4 (0.2) of the 6 planned individual contacts with a registered dietitian. They provided food diaries on a mean (SE) of 5.6 (0.3) occasions during the 6\u00e2\u0080\u0090month intensive intervention period. Satisfaction with the program also did not differ between groups.Concomitant interventions: NR\t \tOutcomes\tChange in body weight (kg) at 3 to < 12 months: YesChange in body weight (kg) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: YesNumber of participants with 5% weight loss from baseline at 3 to < 12 months: NoNumber of participants with 5% weight loss from baseline at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoChange in BMI (kg/m2) at 3 to 12 months: NoChange in BMI (kg/m2) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoNumber of participants with 5% BMI reduction from baseline at 3 to 12 months: NoNumber of participants with 5% BMI reduction from baseline at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoChange in DBP (mmHg) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: YesChange in SBP (mmHg) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: YesAll\u00e2\u0080\u0090cause mortality at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoCardiovascular mortality at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoNon\u00e2\u0080\u0090fatal myocardial infarction at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoNon\u00e2\u0080\u0090fatal stroke at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoDiagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoChange in HbA1c (%) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoChange in LDL (mmol/L) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: YesChange in HDL (mmol/L) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: YesChange in non\u00e2\u0080\u0090HDL (mmom/L) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoChange in total cholesterol (TC) (mmol/L) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoChange in triglycerides (or triacylglycerides) (TG) (mmol/L) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: YesParticipant\u00e2\u0080\u0090reported adverse effects: Yes\t \tNotes\tNumber and type of records(s): journal articleTrial acronym/name: NoneTrial funded by: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (grant R01 DK59240), the Charles H.

Examining the role of a high\u00e2\u0080\u0090protein diet consumed over 12 weeks in slowing the progression heart failure and diabetes mellitusWhat (materials)? Participants were prescribed a hypocaloric diet incorporating a 500 to 800 kcal deficit per day into their individualised energy requirements. This was done through the provision of a standard structured energy\u00e2\u0080\u0090restricted meal plan. Participants were provided with a 'Participant Handbook' containing resources (such as lists of food items and serving sizes) and tools (such as weight charts, food checklists and three\u00e2\u0080\u0090day food records). Participants were also provided with a pedometer.What (procedures)? The high\u00e2\u0080\u0090protein diet consisted of 12 weeks following a diet with a macronutrient composition of 30% fat (~50 g/day), 40% carbohydrate (150 g/day) and 30% protein (~110 g/day). Participants were also encouraged to exercise regularly to promote weight loss, by engaging in 20 to 30 minutes of physical activity. Diet counselling sessions were provided.Who provided? A licenced dietitian provided the counselling sessions.How and where? Face\u00e2\u0080\u0090to\u00e2\u0080\u0090face counselling sessions were provided; the location of sessions was not reported. Sessions were on a one\u00e2\u0080\u0090to\u00e2\u0080\u0090one basis. Spouses, significant family members or friends were asked to participate in the sessions, if appropriate.When and how much? Counselling sessions were provided at visits at baseline, 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks. The duration of sessions was between 45 to 60 minutes. The dietician provided detailed information on the meal plan and keeping daily food logs.Strategies to improve or maintain fidelity; tailoring and modification: Participants received a list of counselling appointments at baseline, and were reminded of sessions by phone call, text or email before each visit. The body weight, waist circumference and dietary intake of participants were reviewed at each visit; dietary adjustments were made if necessary. The dietitian reviewed completed dietary checklists and three\u00e2\u0080\u0090day food records. The latter was done to clarify captured information, verify portions and obtain data that were incomplete. Pedometers were used by participants to monitor their own physical activity, changes in activity were also captured at each follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up visit. The authors also reported the following strategies to improve adherence: establishing a trusting relationship with participants; expressing appreciation for participation with cards and phone calls; providing easy access to investigators and research staff; providing culturally sensitive meal plans; paying for parking during visits; recognising potential barriers and helping to identify solutions; and enlisting family support. Early recognition of non\u00e2\u0080\u0090adherence, identified through three\u00e2\u0080\u0090day food records, prompted additonal education of participants and removal of obstacles.Extent of intervention fidelity: Three\u00e2\u0080\u0090day food records reviewed at each visit were used to assess adherence. The authors reported \"high adherence\" as a strength of the study.Concomitant interventions: Of intervention participants; 82% were treated with ACE inhibitors, 21% with angiotensin receptor blockers, 88% with beta\u00e2\u0080\u0090blockers, 70% with diuretics, 36% with digoxin, 33% with pain medication and 18% with antidepressants.Control diet:Name (as reported) and brief description: Standard\u00e2\u0080\u0090protein diet prescribing 15% protein (~55 g/day), 55% carbohydrates (~200 g/day) and 30% fat (~50 g/day).

Participants were also provided with a pedometer.What (procedures)? The standard\u00e2\u0080\u0090protein diet consisted of 12 weeks following a diet with a macronutrient composition of 30% fat (~50 g/day), 55% carbohydrate (~200 g/day) and 15% protein (~55 g/day). Participants were also encouraged to exercise regularly to promote weight loss, by engaging in 20 to 30 minutes of physical activity. Personalised nutritional counselling sessions were provided.Who provided? A licenced dietitian provided the counselling sessions.How and where? Face\u00e2\u0080\u0090to\u00e2\u0080\u0090face counselling sessions were provided; the location of sessions was not reported. Sessions were on a one\u00e2\u0080\u0090to\u00e2\u0080\u0090one basis. Spouses, significant family members or friends were asked to participate in the sessions, if appropriate.When and how much? Counselling sessions were provided at visits at baseline, 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks. The duration of sessions was between 45 to 60 minutes. The dietician provided detailed information on the meal plan and keeping daily food logs.Strategies to improve or maintain fidelity; tailoring and modification: Participants received a list of counselling appointments at baseline, and were reminded of sessions by phone call, text or email before each visit. The body weight, waist circumference and dietary intake of participants were reviewed at each visit; dietary adjustments were made if necessary. The dietitian reviewed completed dietary checklists and three\u00e2\u0080\u0090day food records. The latter was done to clarify captured information, verify portions and obtain data that were incomplete. Pedometers were used by participants to monitor their own physical activity, changes in activity were also captured at each follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up visit. The authors also reported the following strategies to improve adherence: establishing a trusting relationship with participants; expressing appreciation for participation with cards and phone calls; providing easy access to investigators and research staff; providing culturally sensitive meal plans; paying for parking during visits; recognising potential barriers and helping to identify solutions; and enlisting family support. Early recognition of non\u00e2\u0080\u0090adherence, identified through three\u00e2\u0080\u0090day food records, prompted additonal education of participants and removal of obstacles.Extent of intervention fidelity: Three\u00e2\u0080\u0090day food records reviewed at each visit were used to assess adherence. The authors reported \"high adherence\" as a strength of the study.Concomitant interventions: Of control participants; 63% were treated with ACE inhibitors, 37% with angiotensin receptor blockers, 95% with beta\u00e2\u0080\u0090blockers, 72% with diuretics, 42% with digoxin, 26% with pain medication and 19% with antidepressants.\t \tOutcomes\tChange in body weight (kg) at 3 to < 12 months: YesChange in body weight (kg) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoNumber of participants with 5% weight loss from baseline at 3 to < 12 months: NoNumber of participants with 5% weight loss from baseline at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoChange in BMI (kg/m2) at 3 to 12 months: YesChange in BMI (kg/m2) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoNumber of participants with 5% BMI reduction from baseline at 3 to 12 months: NoNumber of participants with 5% BMI reduction from baseline at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoChange in DBP (mmHg) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoChange in SBP (mmHg) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoAll\u00e2\u0080\u0090cause mortality at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoCardiovascular mortality at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoNon\u00e2\u0080\u0090fatal myocardial infarction at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoNon\u00e2\u0080\u0090fatal stroke at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoDiagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoChange in HbA1c (%) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoChange in LDL (mmol/L) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoChange in HDL (mmol/L) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoChange in non\u00e2\u0080\u0090HDL (mmom/L) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoChange in total cholesterol (TC) (mmol/L) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoChange in triglycerides (or triacylglycerides) (TG) (mmol/L) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoParticipant\u00e2\u0080\u0090reported adverse effects: No\t \tNotes\tNumber and type of records(s): journal articleTrial acronym/name: Pro\u00e2\u0080\u0090HEART trialTrial funded by:\u00c2\u00a0 National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (1R01HL093466), NIH/NCRR/NCATS through the University of California Irvine Institute for Clinical and Translational Science (grant number UL1TR000153) and NIH/NCRR/NCATS through the Universityof California, Los Angeles Clinical and Translational Science Institute (grant number UL1TR000124)Declaration of interest: \"None declared.\" TABLE: Farnsworth 2003 TABLE: Study characteristics\t \tMethods\tReview comparison(s) addressed by this study: 1, 2Study design: RCT, parallel, number of centres NRTrial registry number: NRTotal number of trial arms: 2Year trial started: NRSample size calculation: NoOutcome(s) used for sample size calculation: NADuration of run\u00e2\u0080\u0090in period (weeks): NAWhat was the duration of the weight loss phase: 12 weeksWhat was the duration of the weight maintenance phase: 56 weeksOther notes about methods: NA\t \tParticipants\tCountry and setting: NR; likely Australia based on authors and food suppliersEligibility criteria: Participants were overweight or obese (BMI of 27 to 43 kg/m2) and aged 20 to 65 years, and had to have a fasting serum insulin concentration of > 12 mU/L.

This diet is based on national American guidelines. Such national guidelines have been challenged by proponents of low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets, but limited evidence is currently available.What (materials)? Participants were instructed to follow a prudent diet that included 55% to 60% energy from carbohydrate and less than 10%energy from saturated fat, caloric restriction, increased exercise, and behaviour modification strategies. The LEARN program is intended to be a 16\u00e2\u0080\u0090week programme and, therefore, the 8 weeks of guidance in this study. Participants were assigned to a diet book (the LEARN Manual for Weight Management).What (procedures)? Participants were assigned their diet book, attended regular classes covering the contents of the book and were administered unannounced dietary intake and energy expenditure questionnaires. Participants were instructed to follow a prudent diet that included 55% to 60% energy from carbohydrate and less than 10% energy from saturated fat, caloric restriction, increased exercise, and behaviour modification strategies.Who provided?

Participants were provided with an individualised plan according to a high\u00e2\u0080\u0090protein, medium\u00e2\u0080\u0090dairy diet that included 3 to 4 servings of dairy products (of total energy: 55% carbohydrate; 30% fat and 15% protein, of which 7.5% from dairy protein). They were required to consume twice daily drinks (375 mL) of 1% chocolate milk, directly after exercise and another at least 5 h before or after exercise.Who provided? Diet: registered dietitians, research nutritionists. Exercise training: personal trainer, kinesiologistHow and where? Private nutrition counselling on a biweekly basis, location NR. Exercise in main fitness centre at McMaster University (exercise sessions were mainly individual or in small groups (i.e. 1 trainer to 2\u00e2\u0080\u00903 participants).When and how much? Diet: Biweekly sessions exercise training: supervised aerobic exercise 5 days per week and 2 days unsupervised exercise on the weekend. At each workout participants were to expend 250 kcal. Supervised progressive resistance training regimen 2 days per week (upper body, lower body split). Weight lifted by each participant recorded every session and increased once they could complete 3 sets of 10 repetitions or more at any given weightStrategies to improve or maintain fidelity; tailoring and modification: Every 2 wk thereafter, participants provided a 3\u00e2\u0080\u0090d food record to track compliance with the nutrition protocol. All 3\u00e2\u0080\u0090d food records were analysed with ESHA and participants were provided with feedback in their next biweekly private counseling session. During the week (Monday\u00e2\u0080\u0093Friday), they reported to our study office daily and were often given a SenseWear Pro energy expenditure device (BodyMedia) to wear, programmed for them, so they could track their energy expenditure during their workout. Compliance with weekend workouts was assessed by having women take home and wear the SenseWear Pro device on random occasions. Resistance exercise logs were completed by the trainer and aerobic exercise logs were completed by the participant and checked frequently by study personnel to ensure compliance.Extent of intervention fidelity: Dietary calcium and vitamin D intake increased in the APMD over 16 wk (r234).Concomitant interventions: NR\t \tOutcomes\tChange in body weight (kg) at 3 to < 12 months: YesChange in body weight (kg) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoNumber of participants with 5% weight loss from baseline at 3 to < 12 months: NoNumber of participants with 5% weight loss from baseline at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoChange in BMI (kg/m2) at 3 to 12 months: YesChange in BMI (kg/m2) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoNumber of participants with 5% BMI reduction from baseline at 3 to 12 months: NoNumber of participants with 5% BMI reduction from baseline at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoChange in DBP (mmHg) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoChange in SBP (mmHg) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoAll\u00e2\u0080\u0090cause mortality at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoCardiovascular mortality at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoNon\u00e2\u0080\u0090fatal myocardial infarction at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoNon\u00e2\u0080\u0090fatal stroke at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoDiagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoChange in HbA1c (%) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoChange in LDL (mmol/L) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoChange in HDL (mmol/L) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoChange in non\u00e2\u0080\u0090HDL (mmom/L) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoChange in total cholesterol (TC) (mmol/L) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoChange in triglycerides (or triacylglycerides) (TG) (mmol/L) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoParticipant\u00e2\u0080\u0090reported adverse effects: No\t \tNotes\tNumber and type of records(s): journal articleTrial acronym/name: IDEALTrial funded by: Dairy Farmers of Canada, The Dairy Research Institute and the Canadian Institutes of Health ResearchDeclaration of interest: \"A.

A hypocaloric high\u00e2\u0080\u0090protein diet may result in the suppression of hunger and induction of satiety, resulting in weight loss. It may also result in a positive nitrogen balance, therefore assisting in the maintenance of lean body mass, compared to a hypocaloric high\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diet. Furthermore, it may have positive effects on metabolic parameters, such as b\u00e2\u0080\u0090cell function, cardiovascular risk factors, oxidative stress, and lipid peroxidation.What (materials)? At baseline, an individualised weekly food diary (which included the participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s preferences) was printed and given to each subject with instructions for recording all food intake on a daily basis. Weekly provision of fresh, prepackaged, and frozen foods for the duration of the study. Most of the entrees for the diet were frozen entrees purchased directly from the manufacturer. The diet included 1 cup of frozen vegetables at both lunch and dinner. Snacks in between meals included shakes and meal bars. Participants were given all food needed to meet their dietary assignment for the duration of the study. All food was dispensed by the dietitian at the CRC on a weekly basis to each participant. An individualised weekly food diary (which included the participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s preferences) was printed and given to each subject with instructions for recording all food intake on a daily basis.What (procedures)? High\u00e2\u0080\u0090protein (40% carbohydrates, 30% fat, and 30% protein) hypocaloric diet for 6 months. Weight reduction caloric needs were established for each individual by subtracting 500 kcal/day from their calculated maintenance needs established by REE. Weight loss of 1\u00e2\u0080\u00932 lbs weekly was targeted. On average, an 1800 kcal/day diet for a 70\u00e2\u0080\u0090kg individual was used to achieve adequate weight loss. If a subject reached a plateau and did not lose weight for two consecutive weeks, calories were reduced by an additional 200 kcal or to a minimum of 1200 kcal/day. Caloric adjustments were made by altering the amount of supplement bars and/or shakes. Since these were very similar to the nutrient composition of each diet, they could be easily taken out of the diet to reduce calories but maintain adequate nutrient composition. The study diets provided more than the recommended amount of calcium (1000 mg/day) for women 20\u00e2\u0080\u009350 years of age by providing an average of 1725 mg for HC and 1684 mg for HP diets. Both HP and HC diets were designed to minimise participant health risks. Dietary fat sources focussed on monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, i.e. plant oils, semi\u00e2\u0080\u0090liquid margarine, and nuts; dietary carbohydrate sources emphasised whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and legumes; and dietary protein sources included lean meats, fish, chicken, eggs, and nonfat dairy foods, i.e. fat\u00e2\u0080\u0090free milk and low\u00e2\u0080\u0090fat cheese, consistent with American Diabetes Association and Institute of Medicine guidelines.Who provided?

Substituting protein for carbohydrate while maintaining reduced total fat may have particular benefits in type 2 diabetes. High\u00e2\u0080\u0090protein diets promote weight loss, maintain lean body mass and improve lipid and glycaemic profiles in obese non\u00e2\u0080\u0090diabetic individuals. Studies specifically in type 2 diabetes are limited, are generally short, often using very intensive interventions and/or providing a significant proportion of participants\u00e2\u0080\u0099 food, making the translation of the findings to a general population difficult. Therefore the specific long\u00e2\u0080\u0090term effect of increasing protein intake in individuals with type 2 diabetes in a free\u00e2\u0080\u0090living situation, using an intervention that can be realistically implemented, requires further investigation.What (materials)?

Throughout the 12\u00e2\u0080\u0090mo study, participants were required to attend a 1\u00e2\u0080\u0090h meeting each week.Strategies to improve or maintain fidelity; tailoring and modification: Group meeting with the research dietitians who provided diet information, answered questions, and reviewed diet records for treatment compliance. Participants were required to report 2 3\u00e2\u0080\u0090d weighed food records during the baseline period prior to assignment to diet groups. Nutrient intakes were evaluated as mean daily intakes from the 3\u00e2\u0080\u0090d weighed records using Nutritionist Pro software (First DataBank) for treatment compliance. Compliance with dietary protocols was also monitored with plasma TAG at 0, 4,and 12 mo as a marker of carbohydrate intake and 24\u00e2\u0080\u0090h urinary urea at 0, 4, and 8 mo as a marker of protein intake. High degree of nutrition monitoring throughout the 12 months with weekly meetings that included monitoring body weight, weighed food records, and diet instruction, 3\u00e2\u0080\u0090d weighed food records, which were reviewed each week with feedback to participants about diet compliance. Any participant with an unexcused absence at a weekly meeting was called by a staff dietitian to promote attendance and any participant with 3 consecutive absences was asked to define their participation status in the study.Extent of intervention fidelity: All participants completing data collection participated in < 75% of meetings, including weigh\u00e2\u0080\u0090ins and diet records. Compliance with dietary protocols was also monitored with plasma TAG at 0, 4, and 12 mo as a marker of carbohydrate intake and 24\u00e2\u0080\u0090h urinary urea at 0, 4, and 8 mo as a marker of protein intake.Concomitant interventions: Participants were excluded if they were on lipid\u00e2\u0080\u0090lowering medications, oral steroids or antidepression medication.\t \tOutcomes\tChange in body weight (kg) at 3 to < 12 months: YesChange in body weight (kg) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: YesNumber of participants with 5% weight loss from baseline at 3 to < 12 months: NoNumber of participants with 5% weight loss from baseline at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoChange in BMI (kg/m2) at 3 to 12 months: NoChange in BMI (kg/m2) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoNumber of participants with 5% BMI reduction from baseline at 3 to 12 months: NoNumber of participants with 5% BMI reduction from baseline at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoChange in DBP (mmHg) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoChange in SBP (mmHg) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoAll\u00e2\u0080\u0090cause mortality at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoCardiovascular mortality at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoNon\u00e2\u0080\u0090fatal myocardial infarction at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoNon\u00e2\u0080\u0090fatal stroke at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoDiagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoChange in HbA1c (%) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoChange in LDL (mmol/L) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: YesChange in HDL (mmol/L) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: YesChange in non\u00e2\u0080\u0090HDL (mmom/L) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoChange in total cholesterol (TC) (mmol/L) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoChange in triglycerides (or triacylglycerides) (TG) (mmol/L) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: YesParticipant\u00e2\u0080\u0090reported adverse effects: No\t \tNotes\tNumber and type of records(s): journal articleTrial acronym/name: NoneTrial funded by: National Cattlemen's Beef Association, Beef Checkoff and Kraft FoodsDeclaration of interest: \"D.

Unclear if Chinese people, given their habitually high\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate consumption, are able to adapt to a LC diet for weight control. This study investigated the adherence to a LC diet on weight loss and its effects on the improvement of cardiovascular risk factors among overweight or obese Chinese women, in comparison with an energy\u00e2\u0080\u0090restricted (ER) diet.What (materials)? \"All experimental meals were prepared in a designated kitchen at the hospital. All participants received their experimental meals every day including weekends.\"What (procedures)? The LC diet was designed to provide 20 g carbohydrate daily in the first week, with a gradual increase to 120 g, by adding 10 g weekly until the 11th week, since carbohydrate intake up to 120 g/d has been reported to be sufficient to benefit weight control and metabolic profiles. In addition, a ketogenic diet with no more than 50 g carbohydrate might be rather difficult for a population with a habitually high\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate intake. Carbohydrate\u00e2\u0080\u0090rich foods, such as white rice, steamed bread and tubers, were substituted with fish, poultry and plant oil. In addition to three meals, snacks, including boiled eggs (with or without yolk), cucumbers and tomatoes, were also provided ad libitum any time from 06.00 to 17.30 hours each day. Participants were encouraged to consume every meal in a designated dining room within the building where they worked. Sometimes the participants also consumed meals close to their working place in the hospital if they had a short lunch break. In this case, the participants were required to report to dietitians about any leftovers or intake of foods other than the experimental meals. At the beginning of the intervention, participants were instructed to maintain their usual physical activity levels throughout the study; those in the LC diet group were particularly recommended to drink plenty of plain water, to compensate for possible water loss in ketosis.Who provided?

Nitrogen excretion in urine (NU) was used as a biomarker for protein intake, with three 24\u00e2\u0080\u0090h urine samples collected at baseline and after 6 and 24 months. The para\u00e2\u0080\u0090aminobenzoic acid (PABA) method 14 was used to verify the completeness of the urine collections. NU was determined using the Kjeldahl technique with a Kjeltec analyser (model NMKL nr 6, Eurofins Food & Agro AB, Lidk\u00c3\u00b6ping, Sweden).Extent of intervention fidelity: The PD group reported a significantly lower intake (E% and g/d) of carbohydrates, higher intake (E% and g/d) of protein, MUFA, PUFA, cholesterol, and higher total fat (E%), MUFA:SFA and PUFA:SFA ratios compared to the NNR group. The PD group reported a more pronounced change in the ratio (E%) protein:carbohydrates:total fat from baseline to 6 and 24 months (17:46:33, 23:29:44, 22:34:40; respectively) compared to the NNR group (17:45:35, 19:48:32, 17:43:34; respectively). Target intakes were not fully achieved; the PD did not reach the target amounts of percent energy of protein (30 E%) at 6 and 24 months, and the NNR group did not reach the target amounts of carbohydrates (55\u00e2\u0080\u009060%).Concomitant interventions: NR\t \tOutcomes\tChange in body weight (kg) at 3 to < 12 months: YesChange in body weight (kg) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: YesNumber of participants with 5% weight loss from baseline at 3 to < 12 months: NoNumber of participants with 5% weight loss from baseline at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoChange in BMI (kg/m2) at 3 to 12 months: YesChange in BMI (kg/m2) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: YesNumber of participants with 5% BMI reduction from baseline at 3 to 12 months: NoNumber of participants with 5% BMI reduction from baseline at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoChange in DBP (mmHg) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: YesChange in SBP (mmHg) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: YesAll\u00e2\u0080\u0090cause mortality at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoCardiovascular mortality at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoNon\u00e2\u0080\u0090fatal myocardial infarction at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoNon\u00e2\u0080\u0090fatal stroke at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoDiagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoChange in HbA1c (%) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoChange in LDL (mmol/L) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: YesChange in HDL (mmol/L) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: YesChange in non\u00e2\u0080\u0090HDL (mmom/L) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoChange in total cholesterol (TC) (mmol/L) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: YesChange in triglycerides (or triacylglycerides) (TG) (mmol/L) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: YesParticipant\u00e2\u0080\u0090reported adverse effects: No\t \tNotes\tNumber and type of records(s): journal articleTrial acronym/name: KNOTATrial funded by: The Swedish Council for Working Life and Social Research (grants 2006\u00e2\u0080\u00900699 and 2010\u00e2\u0080\u00900398), the Swedish Research Council (grant K2011\u00e2\u0080\u009012237\u00e2\u0080\u009015\u00e2\u0080\u00906), the Swedish Heart and Lung Foundation, the County Council of V\u00c3\u00a4sterbotten and Ume\u00c3\u00a5 University, SwedenDeclaration of interest: \"The authors declare no conflict of interest.\"Author contacted, but requested information not provided.

The diet was included as a comparator for a standard\u00e2\u0080\u0090protein diet with branched\u00e2\u0080\u0090chain amino acids (BCAAs) supplementation. High\u00e2\u0080\u0090protein diets are stated as reducing the loss of lean mass during weight loss, but they are expensive.What (materials)?

Accelerometers were provided to participants at week 0 and week 8 visits.What (procedures)? The high\u00e2\u0080\u0090protein diet consisted of 16 weeks following a diet with a macronutrient composition of 30% fat, 43% carbohydrate and 27% protein; with placebo supplementation (as opposed to BCAAs). Diet counselling sessions were provided and participants were called to assess and encourage compliance.Who provided? A dietitian provided the counselling sessions and called participants.How and where?

Participants were called on a fortnightly basis; duration not reported.Strategies to improve or maintain fidelity; tailoring and modification: Prescribed meals were provided and delivered to encourage compliance, food checklists were used to document dietary compliance, counselling sessions and regular phone calls from the dietitian were used to assess and encourage compliance. Where certain foods could not be consumed by a participant, the dietitian would substitute with foods of a similar composition to adhere to prescribed energy and macronutrients.Extent of intervention fidelity: Urinary urea:creatinine ratio was used as a surrogate for protein intake and dietary compliance.

Structured meal plans, food diaries, food shopping lists and easy\u00e2\u0080\u0090to\u00e2\u0080\u0090prepare recipes, based on the American Dietetic Association (ADA) exchange system (booklet)What (procedures)? Participants were instructed to consume a high\u00e2\u0080\u0090fat, high\u00e2\u0080\u0090protein diet with regular group and individual sessions over the course of the intervention. Participants were asked to maintain food and beverage diaries and self\u00e2\u0080\u0090monitor their intake goals. Group sessions consisted of nutrition education, behavioural methods and social support. Each participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s caloric prescription represented a deficit of 750 kcal per day from baseline, as calculated from the person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s resting energy expenditure and activity level. Structured meal plans were provided based on the American Dietetic Association (ADA) exchange system.The goal for physical activity was 90 minutes of moderate exercise per week.Who provided? Behavioural counsellors, registered dietitians and 'other study staff members'.How and where? Face\u00e2\u0080\u0090to\u00e2\u0080\u0090face group and individual sessions attended regularly, location NR. Web\u00e2\u0080\u0090based self\u00e2\u0080\u0090monitoring was completed by participants.When and how much? The duration of the intervention was two years. During the first six months, group sessions lasting one hour were provided three out of every four weeks; and thereafter two our of every four weeks for the remainder of the intervention. Individual sessions with dietitians, lasting 30 minutes each, were scheduled every eight weeks for the duration of the intervention. Food and beverage diaries and web\u00e2\u0080\u0090based self\u00e2\u0080\u0090monitoring of food intake was done daily.Strategies to improve or maintain fidelity; tailoring and modification: Participants were instructed to record their food and beverage intake in a daily food diary and in a Web based self\u00e2\u0080\u0090monitoring tool that provided information on how closely their daily food intake met the goals for macronutrients and energy. Behavioural counselling was integrated into the group and individual sessions to promote adherence to the assigned diets (e.g. behavioural strategies such as goal\u00e2\u0080\u0090setting, problem\u00e2\u0080\u0090solving). Self\u00e2\u0080\u0090monitoring indicated how well food intake corresponded with the prescribed macronutrient and energy intakes, regular weight monitoring; team members praised participants for success. Dietary intake of participants was assessed by 24\u00e2\u0080\u0090hour recalls at 6 months and 2 years (three telephone interviews within a 3\u00e2\u0080\u0090week period, 2 weekdays and a weekend day) in a 50% random sample selected. Participation in exercise was monitored by questionnaire (at 12 and 24 months follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up) and by the online self\u00e2\u0080\u0090monitoring tool.Extent of intervention fidelity: Attendance at individual counselling was higher than for group counselling (64.3 versus 53.8% overall, 69.5 versus 55.3% in intervention arm). Adherence data from subsample (n = 177): % Individual sessions attended, means (SD): 69.5 (30.7); % group sessions attended, means (SD): 55.3 (20.0); % of days with completed food entries, means (SD): 60.1 (31.9); % of days with physical activity entries, means (SD): 29.8 (22.4); % discrepancy (kcal goal), means (SD): \u00e2\u0080\u00909.5 (11.4); % discrepancy (protein goal), means (SD): \u00e2\u0080\u009014.5 (13.2); % discrepancy (fat goal), means (SD): \u00e2\u0080\u009013.8 (14.8); % discrepancy (carbohydrate goal), means (SD): \u00e2\u0080\u00901.4 (13.2)Concomitant interventions: Use of medicines at baseline: Antihypertensive medication, n/N (%) : 61/201 (30%); lipid\u00e2\u0080\u0090lowering medication, n/N (%): 31/201 (15%)Control diet:Name (as reported) and brief description: Low\u00e2\u0080\u0090fat average\u00e2\u0080\u0090protein, 20% fat, 15% protein and 65% carbohydrates; 90 min of moderate physical exercise.

YesRecipients: Participants were 62% female, aged 51 (9) years, with BMI 33(4) and weight 94 (16) kg. A total of 25% of participants had a BMI between 25 and 29.9; 75% had a BMI \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 30, and 34% were hypertensive.Why? Studies which followed up participants on different diets found that low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate, high\u00e2\u0080\u0090protein were not superior to high\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate, low\u00e2\u0080\u0090fat diets.What (materials)?

Many patients with type 2 diabetes struggle to adhere to calorie\u00e2\u0080\u0090restricted diets. In the United States and Europe there is much debate about the use of low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. LCD in patients with uncontrolled T2DM is preferable for HbA1c and weight reduction.What (materials)? Recommendation as per\u00c2\u00a0Accurso 2008.

They did, however, report that adherence was good. Carbohydrate intake from baseline to six months decreased from 223.2 (52.4) to 148.8 (31.3) g/day.Concomitant interventions: Four participants (13.3%) were on basal supported oral therapy, and 23.3% on intensive insulin therapy (basal insulin at 17 (11) units/day and bolus insulin at 16 (18) units/day).

Two participants (6.7%) were on GLP\u00e2\u0080\u00901 receptor antagonist. Furthermore, 36.7% were on antihypertensive agents, 66.7% were on lipid\u00e2\u0080\u0090lowering agents and 33.3% were on other medications.Control diet:Name (as reported) and brief description: Calorie\u00e2\u0080\u0090restricted diet (CRD), target carbohydrate content of 50 to 60% TE and 1.0 to 1.2 g protein per kg body weight, with the balance of calories from fat.

Key foods for the macronutrient profile, comprising approximately 30% of energy, were provided for the first eight weeks. Thereafter $40 food vouchers were given to participants for the next 16 weeks. Scales for weighing food were provided.What (procedures)? Subjects were instructed to follow a high\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate low\u00e2\u0080\u0090fat diet and were given key foods for eight weeks and food vouchers for the following 16 weeks to assist with compliance. Semiquantitative food records were kept and food was weighed. Individual consultations with a dietitian comprised dietary advice and meal planning. Three\u00e2\u0080\u0090day food records were kept every two weeks and dietary composition was determined. Dietary intake was assessed by food frequency questionnaire.Who provided? Qualified dietitians provided individual consultations.How and where? Face\u00e2\u0080\u0090to\u00e2\u0080\u0090face consultations with dieticians at a clinic and food records kept by participants at homeWhen and how much? During the course of the 24\u00e2\u0080\u0090week intervention subjects attended the clinic fortnightly for eight weeks and monthly thereafter. Key foods were provided on a fortnightly basis for eight weeks. Food vouchers were provided for the remaining 16 weeks on a monthly basis. Food records were completed daily and individual consultations with dietitians occurred during clinic visits. Three\u00e2\u0080\u0090day food records were done every two weeks and food frequency questionnaires were completed at baseline and 24 weeks.Strategies to improve or maintain fidelity; tailoring and modification: Keeping of food records and analysis thereof for dietary composition, weighing of food, regular determination of body weight and plasma ketones as study outcome, regular meetings with dietitian, provision of key foods and food vouchers. Dietary advice was individualised. Subjects in the HCLF diet were asked to restrict saturated fat intake to < 10 g/day for the study duration.Extent of intervention fidelity: High level of dietary compliance found according to dietary dataConcomitant interventions: In the total group, 17.0% were taking estrogen (12.5% HRT and 4.5% oral contraceptive), 30.7% were on antihypertensive medications, 20.5% were taking lipid\u00e2\u0080\u0090lowering medication and none were taking hypoglycemic medication; no significant differences between medication use in the two trial arms\t \tOutcomes\tChange in body weight (kg) at 3 to < 12 months: YesChange in body weight (kg) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: YesNumber of participants with 5% weight loss from baseline at 3 to < 12 months: YesNumber of participants with 5% weight loss from baseline at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: YesChange in BMI (kg/m2) at 3 to 12 months: YesChange in BMI (kg/m2) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: YesNumber of participants with 5% BMI reduction from baseline at 3 to 12 months: NoNumber of participants with 5% BMI reduction from baseline at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoChange in DBP (mmHg) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: YesChange in SBP (mmHg) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: YesAll\u00e2\u0080\u0090cause mortality at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoCardiovascular mortality at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoNon\u00e2\u0080\u0090fatal myocardial infarction at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoNon\u00e2\u0080\u0090fatal stroke at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoDiagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoChange in HbA1c (%) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoChange in LDL (mmol/L) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: YesChange in HDL (mmol/L) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: YesChange in non\u00e2\u0080\u0090HDL (mmol/L) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: YesChange in total cholesterol (TC) (mmol/L) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: YesChange in triglycerides (or triacylglycerides) (TG) (mmol/L) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: YesParticipant\u00e2\u0080\u0090reported adverse effects: Yes\t \tNotes\tNumber and type of records(s): journal articleTrial acronym/name: NoneTrial funded by: National Heart Foundation of Australia and National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia project grantsDeclaration of interest: \"None of the funding agencies played a role in the conception, design, or conduct of the study collection, management, analysis, and interpretation of the data or in the preparation, review, and approval of the manuscript.\"Author contacted, but requested information not provided.

The aim of this study was therefore to compare the effects of isocaloric HP and HC diets, combined with regular moderate intensity exercise, on glycaemic control and cardiometabolic risk factors in overweight and obese adults with T2DM initially following 12 weeks of active weight loss, and then to re\u00e2\u0080\u0090evaluate the outcomes following 12 weeks of energy balance without the influence of weight change. By including an exercise component, we are able to determine the effects of the dietary patterns when administrated as part of a holistic lifestyle intervention as recommended in the management of T2DM.What (materials)? Core study foods corresponding to their assigned dietary patternWhat (procedures)? HP diet being 32% of total energy as protein, 33% carbohydrate, and 30% total fat (< 10% as saturated fat).

Compared to the HC group, the HP group consumed significantly more protein and less carbohydrate and fibre (P < 0.05 for each nutrient) for each phase. As expected, the total fat intake in the HP diet was higher than the HC diet as a result of larger meat portions and the inclusion of reduced\u00e2\u0080\u0090fat cheese and almonds, however both groups met the dietary recommendations for saturated fat intake (< 10% of energy intake).Concomitant interventions: 58% metformin; 19% insulin; 52% lipid\u00e2\u0080\u0090lowering medication; 61% antihypertensive medicationControl diet:Name (as reported) and brief description: Higher\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diet.

As expected, the total fat intake in the HP diet was higher than the HC diet as a result of larger meat portions and the inclusion of reduced\u00e2\u0080\u0090fat cheese and almonds, however both groups met the dietary recommendations for saturated fat intake (< 10% of energy intake).Concomitant interventions: 64 % meformin; 21% insulin; 64% lipid\u00e2\u0080\u0090lowering medication; 43% antihypertensive medication\t \tOutcomes\tChange in body weight (kg) at 3 to < 12 months: YesChange in body weight (kg) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoNumber of participants with 5% weight loss from baseline at 3 to < 12 months: YesNumber of participants with 5% weight loss from baseline at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoChange in BMI (kg/m2) at 3 to 12 months: YesChange in BMI (kg/m2) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoNumber of participants with 5% BMI reduction from baseline at 3 to 12 months: NoNumber of participants with 5% BMI reduction from baseline at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoChange in DBP (mmHg) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoChange in SBP (mmHg) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoAll\u00e2\u0080\u0090cause mortality at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoCardiovascular mortality at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoNon\u00e2\u0080\u0090fatal myocardial infarction at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoNon\u00e2\u0080\u0090fatal stroke at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoDiagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoChange in HbA1c (%) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoChange in LDL (mmol/L) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoChange in HDL (mmol/L) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoChange in non\u00e2\u0080\u0090HDL (mmom/L) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoChange in total cholesterol (TC) (mmol/L) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoChange in triglycerides (or triacylglycerides) (TG) (mmol/L) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoParticipant\u00e2\u0080\u0090reported adverse effects: Yes\t \tNotes\tNumber and type of records(s): journal articleTrial acronym/name: NoneTrial funded by: Pork Co\u00e2\u0080\u0090operative Research Centre (Pork CRC) grant, an initiative of the Australian governmentDeclaration of interest: \"This study was funded by a grant from the Pork Co\u00e2\u0080\u0090operative Research Centre (Pork CRC), an Australian Government funding initiative.

After inputs from clinicians, recent studies and people wanting to follow weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reduction diets, we considered short\u00e2\u0080\u0090term weight reduction to be a clinician\u00e2\u0080\u0090 and patient\u00e2\u0080\u0090important outcome.\u00c2 APPENDIX: We included four comparisons instead of two as stated in the protocol. This was done in order to separate findings where people implemented only an active weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phase of the diets, from findings where people implemented a weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phase followed by weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phases of the diets (periods where initial diet prescriptions or advice changed to indicate less focus on active weight reduction, for example, changes in energy prescriptions or no restrictions on carbohydrate intake). APPENDIX: We changed one of the sensitivity analyses from \"attrition bias (i.e. first pool all relevant studies per outcome, and then pool only studies with < 15% missing data from the total initial sample)\" to \"first pool all relevant studies per outcome, and then pool only studies with low or some concerns for bias due to missing outcome data (domain 3 in the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool).\" APPENDIX: We excluded the adherence assessment detailed in our protocol as we did not deem it relevant for a review aiming to assess assignment to intervention.

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Debates on effective and safe diets for managing obesity in adults are ongoing. Low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets (also known as 'low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carb diets') continue to be widely promoted, marketed and commercialised as being more effective for weight loss, and healthier, than 'balanced'\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets. Objectives To compare the effects of low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets to weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets with balanced ranges of carbohydrates, in relation to changes in weight and cardiovascular risk, in overweight and obese adults without and with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Search methods We searched MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase (Ovid), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Web of Science Core Collection (Clarivate Analytics), ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) up to 25 June 2021, and screened reference lists of included trials and relevant systematic reviews.\u00c2\u00a0Language or publication restrictions were not applied. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in adults (18 years+) who were overweight or living with obesity, without or with T2DM, and without or with cardiovascular conditions or risk factors. Trials had to compare low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets to balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate (45% to 65% of total energy (TE)) weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets, have a weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phase of 2 weeks or longer and be explicitly implemented for the primary purpose of reducing weight, with or without advice to restrict energy intake.\u00c2 Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts and full\u00e2\u0080\u0090text articles to determine eligibility; and independently extracted data, assessed risk of bias using RoB 2\u00c2\u00a0and assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. We stratified analyses by participants without and with T2DM, and by diets with weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phases only and those with weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phases followed by weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phases. Primary outcomes were change in body weight (kg) and the number of participants per group with weight loss of at least 5%, assessed at short\u00e2\u0080\u0090 (three months to < 12 months) and long\u00e2\u0080\u0090term (\u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months) follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up. Main results We included 61 parallel\u00e2\u0080\u0090arm RCTs that randomised 6925 participants to either low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate or balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets. All trials\u00c2\u00a0were conducted in high\u00e2\u0080\u0090income countries except for one\u00c2\u00a0in China. Most participants (n = 5118 randomised) did not have T2DM. Mean baseline weight across trials was 95 kg (range 66 to 132 kg). Participants with T2DM were older (mean 57 years, range 50 to 65) than those without T2DM (mean 45 years, range 22 to 62). Most trials included men and women (42/61; 3/19 men only; 16/19 women only), and people without baseline cardiovascular conditions, risk factors or events (36/61). Mean baseline diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and low\u00e2\u0080\u0090density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol across trials were within normal ranges. The longest weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phase of diets was two years in participants without and with T2DM. Evidence from studies with weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phases followed by weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phases was limited. Most trials investigated low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets (> 50 g to 150 g per day or < 45% of TE; n = 42), followed by very low (\u00e2\u0089\u00a4 50 g per day or < 10% of TE; n = 14), and then incremental increases from very low to low (n = 5). The most common diets compared were low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate, balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090fat (20 to 35% of TE) and high\u00e2\u0080\u0090protein (> 20% of TE) treatment diets versus control diets balanced\u00c2\u00a0for the three macronutrients (24/61). In most trials (45/61) the energy prescription or approach used to restrict energy intake was similar in both groups. We assessed the overall risk of bias of outcomes across trials as predominantly high, mostly from bias due to missing outcome data. Using GRADE, we assessed the certainty of evidence as moderate to very low across outcomes.\u00c2 Participants without and with T2DM lost weight when following weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phases of both diets at the short (range: 12.2 to 0.33 kg) and long term (range: 13.1 to 1.7 kg).\u00c2 In overweight and obese participants without T2DM: low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets compared to balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets (weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phases only) probably result in little to no difference in change in body weight over three to 8.5 months (mean difference (MD) \u00e2\u0088\u00921.07 kg, (95% confidence interval (CI) \u00e2\u0088\u00921.55 to \u00e2\u0088\u00920.59, I2 = 51%, 3286 participants, 37 RCTs,\u00c2\u00a0moderate\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence) and over one to two years (MD \u00e2\u0088\u00920.93 kg, 95% CI \u00e2\u0088\u00921.81 to \u00e2\u0088\u00920.04, I2 = 40%, 1805 participants, 14 RCTs,\u00c2\u00a0moderate\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence); as well as change in DBP and LDL cholesterol over one to two years. The evidence is very uncertain about whether there is a difference in the number of participants per group with weight loss of at least 5% at one year (risk ratio (RR) 1.11, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.31, I2 = 17%, 137 participants, 2 RCTs,\u00c2\u00a0very low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence).\u00c2 In overweight and obese participants with T2DM: low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets compared to balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets (weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phases only) probably result in little to no difference in change in body weight over three to six months (MD \u00e2\u0088\u00921.26 kg, 95% CI \u00e2\u0088\u00922.44 to \u00e2\u0088\u00920.09, I2\u00c2\u00a0= 47%, 1114 participants, 14 RCTs,\u00c2\u00a0moderate\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence) and over one to two years (MD \u00e2\u0088\u00920.33 kg, 95% CI \u00e2\u0088\u00922.13 to 1.46, I2\u00c2\u00a0= 10%, 813 participants, 7 RCTs,\u00c2\u00a0moderate\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence); as well in change in DBP, HbA1c and LDL cholesterol over 1 to 2 years. The evidence is very uncertain about whether there is a difference in the number of participants per group with weight loss of at least 5% at one to two years (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.20, I2 =\u00c2\u00a00%, 106 participants, 2 RCTs,\u00c2\u00a0very low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence).\u00c2 Evidence on participant\u00e2\u0080\u0090reported adverse effects was limited, and we could not draw any conclusions about these.\u00c2 Authors' conclusions There is probably little to no difference in weight reduction and changes in cardiovascular risk factors up to two years' follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up, when overweight and obese participants without and with T2DM are randomised to either low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate or balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets.\u00c2 Plain language summary Low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets or balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets: which works better for weight loss and heart disease risks?\u00c2 Key messages \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 There is probably little to no difference in the weight lost by people following low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets (also known as 'low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carb diets') compared to the weight lost by people following balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets, for up to two years. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Similarly, there is probably little to no difference between the diets for changes in heart disease risks, like diastolic blood pressure, glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c, a measure of blood sugar levels over 2\u00e2\u0080\u00903 months) and LDL cholesterol (\u00e2\u0080\u0098unhealthy\u00e2\u0080\u0099 cholesterol) up to two years. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 This was the case in people with and without type 2 diabetes. What are low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate and balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets? People spend lots of money on trying to lose weight using diets, products, foods and books, and continue to debate about which diets are effective and safe. So, examining the scientific evidence behind claims made is important. Low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets are a broad category of weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets that manipulate and restrict carbohydrates, protein and fat in diets. There are no consistent, widely\u00e2\u0080\u0090accepted definitions of these diets and different descriptions are used (such as, 'low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate, high\u00e2\u0080\u0090protein\u00e2\u0080\u0099, 'low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate, high\u00e2\u0080\u0090fat', or \u00e2\u0080\u0098very low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate\u00e2\u0080\u0099). Low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets are implemented in different ways, but they restrict grains, cereals and legumes, and other carbohydrate\u00e2\u0080\u0090containing foods; such as dairy, most fruit and certain vegetables. These foods are then typically replaced with foods higher in fat and protein; such as meats, eggs, cheese, butter, cream, oils. Some low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets recommend eating as desired, while others recommend restricting the amount of energy eaten.\u00c2 Balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets contain more moderate amounts of carbohydrates, protein and fats, in line with current healthy eating advice from health authorities. When used for weight reduction, balanced diets recommend restricting the amount of energy eaten by guiding people to reduce their portion sizes and choose healthier foods (e.g. lean instead of fatty meat). Low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets are widely promoted, marketed and commercialised as being more effective for weight loss, and healthier, than 'balanced'\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets. What did we want to find out? We wanted to find out if low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets were better for weight loss and heart disease risk factors than balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets in adults who were overweight or living with obesity. We wanted to find this out for people with and without type 2 diabetes. What did we do?\u00e2\u0080\u00a8We searched six electronic databases and trial registries for all trials* that compared low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets with balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets in adults who were overweight or living with obesity. The trials had to last for at least three months. We compared and summarised the results of the trials and rated our confidence in the combined evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.\u00c2 *A trial is a type of study in which participants are assigned randomly to two or more treatment groups. This is the best way to ensure similar groups of participants. What did we find? We found 61 trials involving 6925 people who were overweight or living with obesity. The biggest trial was in 419 people and the smallest was in 20 people. All except one of the trials were conducted in high\u00e2\u0080\u0090income countries worldwide, and nearly half were undertaken in the USA (26). Most trials (36) were undertaken in people who did not have heart disease or risk factors. Most people (5118 people) did not have type 2 diabetes. The average starting weight of people across the trials was 95 kg. Most studies (37) lasted for six months or less; and the longest studies (6) lasted for two years. Main results Low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets probably result in little to no difference in weight loss over the short term (trials lasting 3 to 8.5 months) and long term (trials lasting one to two years) compared to balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets, in people with and without type 2 diabetes. In the short term, the average difference in weight loss was about 1 kg and in the long term, the average difference was less than 1 kg.\u00c2 People lost weight on both diets in some trials. The amount of weight lost on average varied greatly with both diets across the trials from less than 1 kg in some trials and up to about 12 kg in others in the short term and long term.\u00c2 Similarly, low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets probably result in little to no difference in diastolic blood pressure, glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and LDL cholesterol (\u00e2\u0080\u0098unhealthy\u00e2\u0080\u0099 cholesterol) for up to two years.\u00c2 We could not draw any conclusions about unwanted effects reported by participants because very few trials reported these. What are the limitations of the evidence?\u00c2 We are moderately confident in the evidence. Our confidence was lowered mainly because of concerns about how some the trials were conducted, which included that many trials did not report all their results. Further research may change these results. How up to date is this evidence? The evidence is up\u00e2\u0080\u0090to\u00e2\u0080\u0090date to June 2021.",

Two trials (n = 158 participants randomised) were conducted in participants without and with T2DM\u00c2\u00a0and reported data separately for all (Dyson 2007), or some outcomes (Samaha 2003), which we included in the\u00c2\u00a0appropriate comparisons, where possible. For the descriptions of participants, treatment and control diets that follow in this section, these two trials\u00c2\u00a0(Dyson 2007;\u00c2\u00a0Samaha 2003), are included with both strata of participants (without and with T2DM).\u00c2 Participants without T2DM: weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phase only (comparison 1) and weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phase followed by a weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phase (comparison 2) Sample size: The total numbers of participants randomised to the treatment and control diet arms ranged widely across these trials. The smallest trial randomised 20 participants (Racette 1995). Other small trials with 40 or fewer participants randomised included\u00c2\u00a0Cornier 2005;\u00c2\u00a0Dyson 2007;\u00c2\u00a0Kitabchi 2013\u00c2\u00a0and\u00c2\u00a0Layman 2005. The largest trial in participants without T2DM was\u00c2\u00a0Sacks 2009\u00c2\u00a0(n = 405 randomised), with other trials including > 150 participants being\u00c2\u00a0Foster 2010;\u00c2\u00a0Frisch 2009;\u00c2\u00a0Haufe 2013;\u00c2\u00a0Jesudason 2013;\u00c2\u00a0and\u00c2\u00a0Klemsdal 2010. Gender and age: In three of these trials, only men were eligible\u00c2\u00a0(Benassi\u00e2\u0080\u0090Evans 2009;\u00c2\u00a0Veum 2017;\u00c2\u00a0Wycherley 2012), in 16 only women\u00c2\u00a0(Bales 2017;\u00c2\u00a0Brehm 2003;\u00c2\u00a0Brehm\u00c2\u00a02005;\u00c2\u00a0Cornier 2005;\u00c2\u00a0Foraker 2014;\u00c2\u00a0Gardner 2007;\u00c2\u00a0Griffin 2013;\u00c2\u00a0Jesudason 2013;\u00c2\u00a0Josse 2011;\u00c2\u00a0Kitabchi 2013;\u00c2\u00a0Layman 2005;\u00c2\u00a0Lean 1997;\u00c2\u00a0Liu 2013;\u00c2\u00a0Mateo\u00e2\u0080\u0090Gallego 2017;\u00c2\u00a0Mellberg 2014;\u00c2\u00a0Racette 1995),\u00c2\u00a0and in the rest,\u00c2\u00a0both men and women were eligible. Mean baseline age of participants across these trials was 45 years (range: 22 to 62\u00c2\u00a0years). Weight status: At baseline,\u00c2\u00a0mean body weight and BMI of participants without T2DM was 93.9 kg (range: 65 to 132 kg) and 33.6 kg/m2 (range:\u00c2\u00a030 to 43\u00c2\u00a0kg/m2), respectively. Cardiovascular health and risk factors: The majority of these trials\u00c2\u00a0included participants without cardiovascular conditions, risk factors or events at baseline (n = 30), one included participants with and without these (Aude 2004), and for the\u00c2\u00a0remaining\u00c2\u00a0trials\u00c2\u00a0this was unclear (Bales 2017;\u00c2\u00a0Calleja\u00e2\u0080\u0090Fern\u00c3\u00a1ndez 2012;\u00c2\u00a0Dyson 2007;\u00c2\u00a0Foraker 2014;\u00c2\u00a0Juanola\u00e2\u0080\u0090Falgarona 2014;\u00c2\u00a0Keogh 2007;\u00c2\u00a0Kitabchi 2013;\u00c2\u00a0Lasker 2008;\u00c2\u00a0Layman 2005;\u00c2\u00a0Marco\u00e2\u0080\u0090Benedi 2019;\u00c2\u00a0Mateo\u00e2\u0080\u0090Gallego 2017;\u00c2\u00a0Samaha 2003;\u00c2\u00a0Stentz 2016;\u00c2\u00a0Veum 2017;\u00c2\u00a0Volek 2009). Mean baseline LDL cholesterol concentration across these trials was 3.28 mmol/L (range: 2.58 to 4.47 mmol/L) and mean baseline DBP was 79 mmHg (range: 62 to 92 mmHg). Participants with T2DM: weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phase only (comparison 3) and weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phase followed by a weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phase (comparison 4) Sample size: The smallest trial in participants with T2DM randomised a total of 24 participants to the treatment and control diet arms (Yamada 2014), with other small trials (40 or fewer participants randomised) being\u00c2\u00a0Dyson 2007;\u00c2\u00a0Saslow 2017a;\u00c2\u00a0and\u00c2\u00a0Wycherley 2010. The largest trial in participants with T2DM randomised 419 participants (Krebs 2012). Other trials including more than 130 participants were\u00c2\u00a0Elhayany 2010;\u00c2\u00a0Samaha 2003;\u00c2\u00a0and\u00c2\u00a0Tay 2014. Gender and age: In all trials in participants with T2DM, both men and women were eligible for inclusion. Mean age of participants at baseline was 57 years (range: 50\u00c2\u00a0to 65\u00c2\u00a0years). Weight status: Mean baseline body weight of participants across these trials was 96.7 kg (range: 67 to 132 kg) and mean BMI was 34.5 kg/m2 (range 25\u00c2\u00a0to 42.9\u00c2\u00a0kg/m2). HbA1c: Mean baseline HbA1c of participants across these trials was 7.64% (range: 6.6% to 8.8%). Cardiovascular health: Six of these trials included participants\u00c2\u00a0without cardiovascular conditions, risk factors or events at baseline (Hockaday 1978;\u00c2\u00a0Krebs 2012;\u00c2\u00a0Larsen 2011;\u00c2\u00a0Tay 2014;\u00c2\u00a0Watson 2016;\u00c2\u00a0Wycherley 2010), one included participants with heart failure (Evangelista 2021), and, for the rest of the trials, this was unclear. Mean baseline LDL cholesterol across these trials was 2.63 mmol/L (range: 1.7 to 3.2 mmol/L) and mean baseline DBP was 78 mmHg (range: 70 to 84 mmHg). Treatment and control diets Trials in participants without T2DM: weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phase only (comparison 1) and weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phase followed by a weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phase (comparison 2) Duration: The duration of the weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phases of diets tested in these trials ranged from 12 weeks to two years, as follows: 10 trials for 12 weeks (Aude 2004;\u00c2\u00a0Dyson 2007;\u00c2\u00a0Farnsworth 2003;\u00c2\u00a0Keogh 2007;\u00c2\u00a0Landers 2002;\u00c2\u00a0Liu 2013;\u00c2\u00a0Racette 1995;\u00c2\u00a0Ruth 2013;\u00c2\u00a0Veum 2017;\u00c2\u00a0Volek 2009), eight trials for 16 weeks (Brehm\u00c2\u00a02005;\u00c2\u00a0Cornier 2005;\u00c2\u00a0Goni 2018;\u00c2\u00a0Josse 2011;\u00c2\u00a0Lasker 2008;\u00c2\u00a0Layman 2005;\u00c2\u00a0Ooi 2021;\u00c2\u00a0Parr 2016), 12 trials for six months (Bales 2017;\u00c2\u00a0Brehm 2003;\u00c2\u00a0Foster 2003;\u00c2\u00a0Foster 2010;\u00c2\u00a0Haufe 2013;\u00c2\u00a0Juanola\u00e2\u0080\u0090Falgarona 2014;\u00c2\u00a0Kitabchi 2013;\u00c2\u00a0Lean 1997;\u00c2\u00a0Marco\u00e2\u0080\u0090Benedi 2019;\u00c2\u00a0Mateo\u00e2\u0080\u0090Gallego 2017;\u00c2\u00a0Pittas 2005;\u00c2\u00a0Stentz 2016), 12 trials for one year (Bazzano 2014;\u00c2\u00a0Benassi\u00e2\u0080\u0090Evans 2009;\u00c2\u00a0Calleja\u00e2\u0080\u0090Fern\u00c3\u00a1ndez 2012;\u00c2\u00a0Foraker 2014;\u00c2\u00a0Frisch 2009;\u00c2\u00a0Gardner 2007;\u00c2\u00a0Griffin 2013;\u00c2\u00a0Klemsdal 2010;\u00c2\u00a0Layman 2009;\u00c2\u00a0Samaha 2003;\u00c2\u00a0Tay 2008;\u00c2\u00a0Wycherley 2012), one trial for 15 months (Lim 2010), one trial for 18 months (Ebbeling 2007), and three trials for two years (Jesudason 2013;\u00c2\u00a0Mellberg 2014;\u00c2\u00a0Sacks 2009). We used only the data from the first six months in two trials with total durations of one year (Foster 2003) and two years (Foster 2010) since the treatment diets were ineligible from six months onwards due to the prescribed incremental carbohydrate increases. The results for only the active weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phases of the diets in participants without T2DM were reported in comparison 1. Five of these trials also implemented a weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phase following the weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phase for six weeks (Racette 1995), 40 weeks (Keogh 2007), 56 weeks (Farnsworth 2003), a variable time period with an average of 18 months (Haufe 2013) and 21 months (Dyson 2007), and these results were reported in comparison 2. Macronutrient prescription:\u00c2\u00a0Table 5\u00c2\u00a0contains the thresholds and ranges\u00c2\u00a0used to characterise\u00c2\u00a0the macronutrient prescriptions of the treatment and control diets in this review. In\u00c2\u00a0Table 6, we used the characterisations in\u00c2\u00a0Table 5\u00c2\u00a0to summarise the macronutrient compositions of the\u00c2\u00a0treatment and control diets tested in each trial in participants without T2DM.\u00c2 The extent of carbohydrate restriction in the treatment diets ranged from\u00c2\u00a0very low\u00c2\u00a0(\u00e2\u0089\u00a4 50 g per day or < 10% of total daily energy intake) (n = 11) to\u00c2\u00a0low\u00c2\u00a0(> 50 g to 150 g per day or < 45% of total energy intake) (n = 31), with five trials examining the effects of treatment diets with\u00c2\u00a0incremental increases in carbohydrates\u00c2\u00a0from very low to low (Table 6). Implementation of\u00c2\u00a0these incremental increases varied widely across the five trials, with the prescribed time for following the very low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets ranging\u00c2\u00a0from one week to\u00c2\u00a0three months. Different prescriptions for incremental increases\u00c2\u00a0in carbohydrate intake in the later phases included increases from 10% to 27% of total energy as carbohydrates, by 5 g/day/week,\u00c2\u00a0by 10 g\u00c2\u00a0weekly, and\u00c2\u00a0from 20 g to 50 g per day. As expected, the protein and fat proportions of treatment diets\u00c2\u00a0also varied concordantly.\u00c2\u00a0The control diets in the\u00c2\u00a0majority of trials in participants without T2DM were balanced for carbohydrates, fat and protein (n = 38) (Table 6).\u00c2 The most common diets compared\u00c2\u00a0across the trials in participants without T2DM were\u00c2\u00a0low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate, balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090fat and high\u00e2\u0080\u0090protein treatment diets compared to control diets balanced\u00c2\u00a0for all three macronutrients (n = 19), followed by very low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate treatment diets with unspecified fat and protein contents compared to control diets with balanced proportions of\u00c2\u00a0carbohydrates, fat and protein (n = 7)\u00c2\u00a0(Table 6). Total energy prescription: In most of these trials, the total energy prescription was similar, or the approach used to restrict energy intake was similar in treatment and control groups (n = 34). In nine other trials, the energy prescription was ad libitum in the treatment diets and restricted in the control diets (Aude 2004;\u00c2\u00a0Brehm 2003;\u00c2\u00a0Brehm\u00c2\u00a02005;\u00c2\u00a0Foster 2003;\u00c2\u00a0Foster 2010;\u00c2\u00a0Gardner 2007;\u00c2\u00a0Landers 2002;\u00c2\u00a0Liu 2013;\u00c2\u00a0Samaha 2003). In the remaining trials, no energy prescription was reported, or unrestricted energy intake was prescribed for both treatment and control diets (Bazzano 2014;\u00c2\u00a0Ebbeling 2007;\u00c2\u00a0Mellberg 2014;\u00c2\u00a0Volek 2009). Trials in participants with T2DM: weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phase only (comparison 3) and weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phase followed by a weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phase (comparison 4) Duration: The duration of the weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phases of diets tested in these trials ranged from 12 weeks to two years, as follows: four trials for 12 weeks (Dyson 2007;\u00c2\u00a0Evangelista 2021;\u00c2\u00a0Larsen 2011;\u00c2\u00a0Watson 2016), one trial for 16 weeks (Wycherley 2010), three trials for six months (Sato 2017;\u00c2\u00a0Westman 2008;\u00c2\u00a0Yamada 2014), five trials for one year (Elhayany 2010;\u00c2\u00a0Hockaday 1978;\u00c2\u00a0Pedersen 2014;\u00c2\u00a0Samaha 2003;\u00c2\u00a0Saslow 2017a), and three trials for two years (Guldbrand 2012;\u00c2\u00a0Krebs 2012;\u00c2\u00a0Tay 2014). The results for only the active weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phases of diets in participants with T2DM were reported in comparison 3. Four of these trials also implemented a weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phase following their weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phase for 12 weeks (Watson 2016), nine months (Larsen 2011), 12 months (Sato 2017), and 21 months (Dyson 2007), and we reported these results in comparison 4. Macronutrient prescriptions:\u00c2\u00a0Table 7\u00c2\u00a0summarises\u00c2\u00a0the macronutrient prescriptions of the\u00c2\u00a0treatment and control diets tested in each trial in participants with T2DM using the characterisations in\u00c2\u00a0Table 5.\u00c2 The extent of carbohydrate restriction in the treatment diets ranged from\u00c2\u00a0very low (\u00e2\u0089\u00a4 50 g per day) (n = 5) to\u00c2\u00a0low\u00c2\u00a0(> 50 g to 150 g per day or < 45% of total energy intake) (n = 11). No trials in participants with T2DM tested treatment diets with incremental increases in carbohydrates. Protein and fat proportions of treatment diets varied concordantly or were not reported.\u00c2\u00a0The control diets in the\u00c2\u00a0majority of trials in participants with T2DM were balanced for carbohydrates, fat and protein (n = 13) (Table 7).\u00c2 As seen in the trials in participants without T2DM, the most common treatment diets compared\u00c2\u00a0across the trials in participants with T2DM were\u00c2\u00a0'low'\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate, balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090fat and high\u00e2\u0080\u0090protein treatment diets compared to control diets balanced\u00c2\u00a0for all three macronutrients (n = 5). This was followed by 'very low'\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate treatment diets with unspecified fat and protein contents compared to control diets with balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrates and unspecified fat and protein contents (n = 2)\u00c2\u00a0(Table 7). Total energy prescription: In most of these trials, the total energy prescription was similar, or the approach used to restrict energy intake was similar in treatment and control groups (n = 11). In the remaining trials, the energy prescription was ad libitum in the treatment diets and restricted in the control diets (Samaha 2003;\u00c2\u00a0Saslow 2017a;\u00c2\u00a0Sato 2017;\u00c2\u00a0Westman 2008;\u00c2\u00a0Yamada 2014).

Funding of included trials About 60% (n = 28) of the trials including participants without T2DM reported being funded only by non\u00e2\u0080\u0090commercial funders, including government and public research institutes, while 36% (n = 17) reported some or all funding by food/diet industry and related private companies, such as food and nutrition product manufacturers, organisations representing the interests of food producers (e.g. Pork Council, Dairy Farmers Association) and diet book and diet product organisations (Bales 2017;\u00c2\u00a0Benassi\u00e2\u0080\u0090Evans 2009;\u00c2\u00a0Dyson 2007;\u00c2\u00a0Farnsworth 2003;\u00c2\u00a0Frisch 2009;\u00c2\u00a0Griffin 2013;\u00c2\u00a0Josse 2011;\u00c2\u00a0Lasker 2008;\u00c2\u00a0Layman 2005;\u00c2\u00a0Layman 2009;\u00c2\u00a0Lean 1997;\u00c2\u00a0Liu 2013;\u00c2\u00a0Parr 2016;\u00c2\u00a0Racette 1995;\u00c2\u00a0Ruth 2013;\u00c2\u00a0Volek 2009;\u00c2\u00a0Wycherley 2012). Sources of funding were not reported by two trials in participants without T2DM (Aude 2004;\u00c2\u00a0Landers 2002). About a third of trials including participants with T2DM (38%; n = 6) were funded solely by non\u00e2\u0080\u0090commercial funders, with seven trials (41%) reporting some or all funding by food/diet industry and related private companies (Dyson 2007;\u00c2\u00a0Hockaday 1978;\u00c2\u00a0Larsen 2011;\u00c2\u00a0Sato 2017;\u00c2\u00a0Watson 2016;\u00c2\u00a0Westman 2008;\u00c2\u00a0Wycherley 2010), and three trials not reporting funding source (Elhayany 2010;\u00c2\u00a0Pedersen 2014;\u00c2\u00a0Yamada 2014).

The nine ongoing studies are detailed in\u00c2\u00a0Characteristics of ongoing studies. Risk of bias in included studies Risk of bias assessments\u00c2\u00a0for each outcome included in the summary of findings tables, along with all domain judgements, are included in the forest plots.\u00c2\u00a0Figure 2\u00c2\u00a0provides our judgements about each risk of bias item presented as percentages across all included trials for bias arising from the randomisation process, and across all outcomes in the summary of findings tables for all other items using RoB 2. Additional information, such as support for judgements, is located\u00c2\u00a0in the\u00c2\u00a0risk of bias\u00c2\u00a0section (located after the\u00c2\u00a0Characteristics of ongoing studies).\u00c2 For most trials in participants without T2DM, the risk of bias arising from the randomisation process was judged as having 'some concerns' (n = 25), 10 trials were judged as low risk (Bales 2017;\u00c2\u00a0Dyson 2007;\u00c2\u00a0Ebbeling 2007;\u00c2\u00a0Gardner 2007;\u00c2\u00a0Griffin 2013;\u00c2\u00a0Haufe 2013;\u00c2\u00a0Jesudason 2013;\u00c2\u00a0Liu 2013;\u00c2\u00a0Marco\u00e2\u0080\u0090Benedi 2019;\u00c2\u00a0Sacks 2009), and four trials as high risk for this domain (Keogh 2007;\u00c2\u00a0Parr 2016;\u00c2\u00a0Tay 2008;\u00c2\u00a0Wycherley 2012). The overall risk of bias of outcomes across trials in participants without T2DM was similar and predominantly high. High overall risk of bias judgements were mostly as a result of bias due to missing outcome data, with high proportions of missing outcome data in many trials and this not being adequately handled by recommended statistical approaches. Bias due to deviations from intended interventions also contributed to high overall risk of bias. Problems with the measurement of outcomes did not contribute to high overall risk as most outcomes were not subjective or observer\u00e2\u0080\u0090reported; the exception was constipation, which was participant\u00e2\u0080\u0090reported and judged as high risk for most of the trials. None of the trials for any outcome in participants without T2DM reported prespecified analysis intentions in sufficient detail to enable assessment of selection of the reported result. Three trials did not contribute any numeric data to meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analyses and risk of bias for these trials was not assessed, in line with guidance on implementing RoB 2 (Foster 2003;\u00c2\u00a0Pittas 2005;\u00c2\u00a0Racette 1995).\u00c2\u00a0Five trials did not report any outcomes included in the summary of findings tables, and we did not assess risk of bias of these (Juanola\u00e2\u0080\u0090Falgarona 2014;\u00c2\u00a0Kitabchi 2013;\u00c2\u00a0Ruth 2013;\u00c2\u00a0Samaha 2003;\u00c2\u00a0Stentz 2016).\u00c2 Bias arising from the randomisation process was judged as low risk for approximately half of the trials in participants with T2DM (n = 8) (Dyson 2007;\u00c2\u00a0Evangelista 2021;\u00c2\u00a0Krebs 2012;\u00c2\u00a0Larsen 2011;\u00c2\u00a0Pedersen 2014;\u00c2\u00a0Saslow 2017a;\u00c2\u00a0Sato 2017;\u00c2\u00a0Watson 2016), with the remaining trials judged as having 'some concerns' (Elhayany 2010;\u00c2\u00a0Guldbrand 2012;\u00c2\u00a0Samaha 2003;\u00c2\u00a0Tay 2014;\u00c2\u00a0Westman 2008;\u00c2\u00a0Wycherley 2010;\u00c2\u00a0Yamada 2014). Across trials in participants with T2DM, the overall risk of bias of outcomes was similar and mostly high. As in the trials in participants without T2DM, the high overall risk of bias judgements were largely driven by bias due to missing outcome data, with high proportions of missing data not being adequately handled, and to a lesser extent by bias due to deviations from intended interventions. None of the trials in participants with T2DM reported prespecified analysis intentions in sufficient detail to enable us to assess the selection of the reported result. We did not assess risk of bias for one older study as it did not contribute usable data for an outcome included in the summary of findings tables (Hockaday 1978).\u00c2 Effects of interventions See: Table 1; Table 2; Table 3; Table 4 See:\u00c2\u00a0Table 1;\u00c2\u00a0Table 2;\u00c2\u00a0Table 3;\u00c2\u00a0Table 4. We analysed results from trials in overweight and obese participants without T2DM separately from those in participants with T2DM. We also separated analyses for weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phases of diets, and for weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phases followed by weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phases. We report here the effects on the prespecified outcomes according to the four comparisons resulting from these stratifications.\u00c2 We assessed the follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up periods for the various outcomes as short term (three to < 12 months) or long term (\u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months). The exact author\u00e2\u0080\u0090reported follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up periods per outcome per trial appear as footnotes in each forest plot (i.e. using weeks, months or years). To summarise the follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up period applicable per outcome, we also reported the specific follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up range across all the trials that reported on that outcome. None of the included trials reported on the following outcomes for any of the four comparisons: all\u00e2\u0080\u0090cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, non\u00e2\u0080\u0090fatal myocardial infarction, non\u00e2\u0080\u0090fatal stroke and diagnosis of T2DM. Trials without usable data for outcomes in the summary of findings tables are summarised in\u00c2\u00a0Table 8\u00c2\u00a0for comparisons 1 and 2 and in\u00c2\u00a0Table 9\u00c2\u00a0for comparisons 3 and 4. \u00c2\u00a0\u00c2 The assumed risk in comparison groups was expressed as the range of change values reported in the balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diet groups across the studies that reported results for a given outcome. If only end values were reported for a given outcome, a mean change value was calculated by using the mean baseline value and subtracting it from the reported mean end value.\u00c2 Comparison 1. Low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets versus balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets in overweight and obese participants without T2DM (weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phase only) Table 1\u00c2\u00a0presents the effects of low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets compared to balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets (weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phase only) in overweight and obese participants without T2DM on short\u00e2\u0080\u0090term (three to <12 months) and long\u00e2\u0080\u0090term (\u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months) changes in body weight, as well as on the number of participants per group with weight loss of at least 5% over the long term, long\u00e2\u0080\u0090term change in DBP and LDL cholesterol, and short\u00e2\u0080\u0090term constipation. Key details about studies in this comparison, including characteristics of the intervention, population, outcomes and method of synthesis, are included in the Overview of Synthesis and Included Studies (OSIS) table (Table 10). Primary outcomes Change in body weight (kg) at three to < 12 months GRADE assessment suggests that low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets probably result in little to no difference in change in body weight over three to 8.5 months compared to balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets in overweight and obese participants without T2DM (moderate\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias).\u00c2 Average weight reductions from baseline over the short term ranged from 12.18 kg to 4.45 kg with low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets and from 11.34 kg to 2.3 kg with balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets in the 37 trials that reported this outcome. The meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis showed little to no difference in weight reduction on average between low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate and balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diet groups (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00901.07 kg, (95% confidence interval (CI) \u00e2\u0080\u00901.55 to \u00e2\u0080\u00900.59, I2 = 51%, 3286 participants, 37 RCTs,\u00c2\u00a0moderate\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 1.1) over three to 8.5 months. This lack of a difference in effect was confirmed by sensitivity analyses, including only trials with 'some concerns' of bias overall (Analysis 1.6; no trials at overall low risk of bias), those at low risk of attrition bias (Analysis 1.7) and those without reported diet/food industry funding (Analysis 1.8).\u00c2 Subgrouping by similarity of energy prescription (Analysis 1.2), extent of carbohydrate restriction (Analysis 1.3), diagnosed cardiovascular event or disease at baseline (Analysis 1.4) or gender (Analysis 1.5) did not suggest important clinical differences in average effects between subgroups, with mean differences in weight reduction in overweight and obese participants at three to < 12 months ranging between 0.25 kg and 2.71 kg across the various subgroups. Subgrouping by similarity of energy prescription and extent of carbohydrate restriction explained some heterogeneity. Heterogeneity was reduced (I2 = 0%) in the subgroup including only trials with similar energy prescriptions/approaches to energy restriction in both diets, and in the subgroup including only trials investigating low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets (> 50 g to 150 g per day or < 45% of total energy intake). We did not downgrade for inconsistency. The subgroup including only trials with no energy prescriptions or unrestricted energy prescriptions in both diets had small total numbers of participants (n < 400). This was also the case for the subgroup of trials only including men.\u00c2 Nine trials reported this outcome in an unusable format (e.g. in figures or as percentage change in weight from baseline) and usable data were not provided when authors were contacted (Table 8). The funnel plot (Figure 3) shows most trials had similar standard errors of intervention effect estimates limiting the ability to assess asymmetry. The mean difference in fixed\u00e2\u0080\u0090effect analysis, which gives less weight to small studies (\u00e2\u0080\u00900.91 kg, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00901.21 to \u00e2\u0080\u00900.62), is similar to the mean difference in random\u00e2\u0080\u0090effects meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis (\u00e2\u0080\u00901.07 kg, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00901.55 to \u00e2\u0080\u00900.59,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 1.1), which gives more weight to smaller studies, suggesting that any small\u00e2\u0080\u0090study effects have little effect on the intervention effect estimate. Thirteen of the 37 trials had follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up at three months from baseline, nine at four months, 13 at six months, one at 26 weeks (about 6.5 months), and one trial at 34 weeks (about 8.5 months) Change in body weight (kg) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months GRADE assessment suggests that low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets probably result in little to no difference to change in body weight over one to two years compared to balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets in overweight and obese participants without T2DM (moderate\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias). Long\u00e2\u0080\u0090term average weight reductions in the 14 trials that reported this outcome ranged from 13.1 kg to 2.46 kg in low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diet groups and from 11.6 kg to 1.7 kg in balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diet groups. The meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis of the mean difference in weight reduction between the low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate and balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets demonstrated little to no difference at one to two years (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00900.93 kg, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00901.81 to \u00e2\u0080\u00900.04, I2 = 40%, 1805 participants, 14 RCTs,\u00c2\u00a0moderate\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 1.9). Sensitivity analyses including only trials at low risk of attrition bias (Analysis 1.10) and trials without diet/food industry funding confirmed this lack of a difference in effect (Analysis 1.11). Other planned sensitivity analyses included fewer than two studies and thus were not performed. Two trials reported this outcome in an unusable format (e.g. in figures or as percentage change in weight from baseline) and usable data were not provided when authors were contacted (Table 8). The funnel plot (Figure 4) suggests that smaller studies may be missing. The mean difference in fixed\u00e2\u0080\u0090effect analysis, which gave less weight to small studies (\u00e2\u0080\u00900.81 kg, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00901.43 to \u00e2\u0080\u00900.19), was similar to the mean difference in the random\u00e2\u0080\u0090effects meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis (\u00e2\u0080\u00900.93 kg, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00901.81 to \u00e2\u0080\u00900.04,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 1.9), which gave more weight to smaller studies, suggesting that any small\u00e2\u0080\u0090study effects had little effect on the intervention effect estimate. Ten of the 14 trials had follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up at one year, one at 15 months, one at 74 weeks (about 18.5 months), with the two longest trials having follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up at two years. Number of participants per group with weight loss of at least 5% at three to < 12 months The number of participants achieving at least 5% weight loss over the short term in the three trials reporting this outcome ranged from 14 to 41 with low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets and from eight to 35 with balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets. The meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis of the risk ratio (RR) of the number of participants per group with weight loss of at least 5% at three to six months was 1.30 (95% CI 1.00 to 1.68, I2 = 47%, 161 participants, 3 RCTs,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 1.12) when comparing low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate and balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diet groups. Two of the three trials that reported this outcome had follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up at three months and the other at six months. Number of participants per group with weight loss of at least 5% at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months GRADE assessment suggests that the evidence is very uncertain about whether there is a difference in the number of participants per group with weight loss of at least 5% at one year, when comparing low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets with balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets in overweight and obese participants without T2DM (very low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence; downgraded once for risk of bias and twice for imprecision). Two studies reported on this outcome at one year (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.31; I\u00c2\u00b2 = 17%; 137 participants, 2 RCTs,\u00c2\u00a0very low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 1.13), with the number of participants achieving at least 5% weight loss ranging from 28 to 30 in the low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing group and from 27 to 29 in the balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing group. Another included trial also measured this outcome at two years but it was not reported in a usable format (Table 8).\u00c2 Secondary outcomes For comparison 1, no trials reported on the number of participants per group with reduction in BMI (kg/m2) of at least 5% at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months. Change in BMI (kg/m2) at three to < 12 months Twenty\u00e2\u0080\u0090one trials (n = 1517 participants) reported on short\u00e2\u0080\u0090term BMI change for comparison 1, with five of the 20 trials having follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up at three months, five at four months and 11 trials at six months. Across the trials, average reduction in BMI from baseline ranged from 4.7 kg/m2 to 1.8 kg/m2 with low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets and from 3.7 kg/m2 to 0.98 kg/m2 with balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diet groups. We did not pool these results into an overall effect estimate due to substantial heterogeneity (I\u00c2\u00b2 = 53%, Tau\u00c2\u00b2 = 0.18; Chi\u00c2\u00b2 = 42.52, df = 20 (P = 0.002)) but rather presented the individual effect sizes between the low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate and balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets per study\u00c2\u00a0(Analysis 1.14).\u00c2 Change in BMI (kg/m2) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months Average reduction in BMI from baseline over the long term in the five trials reporting this outcome ranged from 5.2 kg/m2 to 1.65 kg/m2 in low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diet groups and from 4.1 kg/m2 to 0.92 kg/m2 in balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diet groups.\u00c2\u00a0When low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets were compared to balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets, the difference in BMI change on average at one to two years was \u00e2\u0080\u00900.61 kg/m2 (95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00900.99 to \u00e2\u0080\u00900.23, I2 = 0%, 490 participants, 5 RCTs,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 1.15). Four trials had follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up at one year and the remaining trial at two years. Number of participants per group with reduction in BMI (kg/m2) of at least 5% at three to < 12 months A single small study reported on this outcome at three months and the risk ratio was 1.57 (95% CI 0.79 to 3.12, 55 participants, 1 RCT,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 1.16) with 14 participants in the low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing group and eight participants in the balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing group achieving at least 5% reduction in BMI. Change in DBP (mmHg) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months GRADE assessment suggests that low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets probably result in little to no difference to change in DBP compared to balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets over one to two years in overweight and obese participants without T2DM (moderate\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias). Over one to two years, average change in DBP from baseline ranged from a 9 mmHg reduction to a 4 mmHg increase with low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets and from an 11 mmHg reduction to 2.9 mmHg increase with balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets across the 11 trials that reported this. The meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis of the mean difference in change in DBP between the low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate and balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets demonstrated little to no difference at one to two years (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00900.09 mmHg, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00901.29 to 1.12, I2 = 44%, 1419 participants, 11 RCTs, moderate\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 1.17). Seven of the 11 trials had follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up at one year, one at 15 months, one at 18 months and the other two trials at two years. Change in SBP (mmHg) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months Average change in SBP from baseline in the 11 trials reporting this outcome ranged from reductions of 13.8 mmHg to 0.2 mmHg in low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diet groups and from a reduction of 14.6 mmHg to an increase of 1.7 mmHg in balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diet groups over one to two years of follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up. For this comparison, the mean difference in change in SBP at one to two years was \u00e2\u0080\u00901.37 mmHg (95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00902.99 to 0.24, I2 = 34%, 1397 participants, 11 RCTs,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 1.18). Seven of the 11 trials had follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up at one year, one at 15 months, one at 18 months and the other two trials at two years. Change in LDL cholesterol (mmol/L) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months GRADE assessment suggests that low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets probably result in little to no difference in change in LDL cholesterol over one to two years compared to balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets in overweight and obese participants without T2DM (moderate\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias). Over one to two years, average change in LDL cholesterol from baseline across the 13 trials that reported this outcome ranged from reduction of 0.3 mmol/L to an increase of 0.6 mmol/L with low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets and from a reduction of 0.31 mmol/L to an increase of 0.1 mmol/L with balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets. The meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis of the mean difference in change in LDL cholesterol between the low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate and balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets demonstrated little to no difference at one to two years (MD 0.04 mmol/L 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00900.05 to 0.12, I2 = 33%, 1494 participants, 13 RCTs, moderate\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 1.19). Nine of the 13 trials had follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up at one year, one at 15 months, one at 18 months and the other two trials at two years. One of the included trials measured this outcome but it was not reported in a usable format (Table 8).\u00c2 Change in HDL cholesterol (mmol/L) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months Average change in HDL cholesterol from baseline over one to two years ranged from a reduction of 0.1 mmol/L to an increase of 0.3 mmol/L in low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diet groups and from a reduction of 0.21 mmol/L to an increase of 0.18 mmol/L in balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diet groups in the 13 trials that reported this outcome. When low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets were compared to balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets, the mean difference in change in HDL cholesterol at one to two years was 0.06 mmol/L (95% CI 0.02 to 0.10, I2 = 48%, 1519 participants, 13 RCTs,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 1.20). Nine of the 13 trials had follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up at one year, one at 15 months, one at 18 months and the other two trials at two years. Change in non\u00e2\u0080\u0090HDL cholesterol (mmol/L) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months Two small studies reported on this outcome at one year and the mean difference in non\u00e2\u0080\u0090HDL cholesterol was 0.06 mmol/L (95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00900.2 to 0.33, I2 = 47%, 225 participants, 2 RCTs,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 1.21) with average change in non\u00e2\u0080\u0090HDL ranging from a reduction of 0.13 mmol/L to an increase of 0.24 mmol/L in low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing groups and average reductions ranging from 0.1 mmol/L to 0.02 mmol/L in balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing groups.\u00c2 Change in total cholesterol (mmol/L) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months Over one to two years, average change in total cholesterol from baseline ranged from a reduction of 0.4 mmol/L to an increase of 0.7 mmol/L with low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets and from a reduction of 0.42 mmol/L to an increase of 0.13 mmol/L with balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets across the 11 trials that reported this. On average, there was no difference in change in total cholesterol at one to two years between the two types of diet (MD 0.01 mmol/L, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00900.1 to 0.12, I2 = 41%, 1291 participants, 11 RCTs,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 1.22). Eight of the 11 trials had follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up at one year, one at 15 months and the other two trials at two years. Change in triglycerides (mmol/L) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months Across the 13 trials that reported on triglycerides over one to two years, average change from baseline ranged from reductions of 0.58 mmol/L to 0.1 mmol/L with low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets and from a reduction of 0.44 mmol/L to an increase of 0.02 mmol/L with balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets. For this comparison, the mean difference in change in triglycerides at one to two years was \u00e2\u0080\u00900.11 mmol/L (95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00900.16 to \u00e2\u0080\u00900.06, I2 = 0%, 1559 participants, 13 RCTs,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 1.23). Nine of the 13 trials had follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up at one year, one at 15 months, one at 18 months and the other two trials at two years. Participant\u00e2\u0080\u0090reported adverse effects Participant\u00e2\u0080\u0090reported adverse effects were scantily reported by six included trials for comparison 1, with all outcomes except short\u00e2\u0080\u0090term constipation being reported only by single trials, and one of the trials reporting on most of these outcomes (Bazzano 2014). All 19 dichotomous outcomes reported very few events, had small total sample sizes and had wide 95% CIs. The four continuous outcomes all had small total samples sizes, mean differences close to 0 and wide 95% CIs. Gastrointestinal GRADE assessment suggests that the evidence is very uncertain about whether there is a difference in the number of participants per group with constipation at three to six months when comparing low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets with balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets in overweight and obese participants without T2DM (very low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias and twice for imprecision).\u00c2 The meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis of the risk ratio of the number of participants per group reporting constipation at three to six months was 1.06 (95% CI 0.81 to 1.38, I2 = 0%, 564 participants, 4 RCTs,\u00c2\u00a0very low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 1.24) when comparing the two diet groups.\u00c2 One trial reported constipation at one year (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.25, 148 participants, 1 RCT,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 1.25). Two trials reported on events of diarrhoea finding no difference over the shorter term (at three months and at six months) (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.33 to 2.93, 244 participants, 2 RCTs,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 1.26) or at one year (RR 0.32, 95% CI\u00c2\u00a00.03 to 3.05, 148 participants, 1 RCT,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 1.27). This was also the case for nausea over the shorter term (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.05 to 10.68, 244 participants, 2 RCTs,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 1.28) and at one year (RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.65, 148 participants, 1 RCT,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 1.29).\u00c2 One trial reported on events offlatulence at six months (RR 0.75, 95% CI\u00c2\u00a00.44 to 1.30, 148 participants, 1 RCT,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 1.30) and again at one year (RR 0.68 95% CI\u00c2\u00a00.39 to 1.17, 148 participants, 1 RCT,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 1.31), as well on events of heartburn at six months (RR 0.53, 95% CI\u00c2\u00a00.21 to 1.36, 148 participants, 1 RCT,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 1.32) and at one year (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.01, 148 participants, 1 RCT,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 1.33). One trial reported on halitosis at six months (RR 1.99, 95% CI 1.32 to 2.99, 263 participants, 1 RCT,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 1.34) and another trial reported stomach upsets at three months (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.41 to 2.45, 96 participants, 1 RCT,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 1.35). Appetite and hunger Appetite change was reported by one trial at six months follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up (RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.01 to 3.99, 148 participants, 1 RCT,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 1.36) and at one year (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.05 to 5.25, 148 participants, 1 RCT,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 1.37). In another trial, hunger and desire to eat were gauged using a visual analog score as change from baseline at one year for this comparison. The mean score for hunger was \u00e2\u0080\u00901.05 (SEM 0.56; n = 21) in the low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diet group and \u00e2\u0080\u00900.18 (SEM 0.66; n = 15) in the balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diet group. Mean scores for desire to eat were \u00e2\u0080\u00901.02 (SEM 0.59; n = 21) in the low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diet group and \u00e2\u0080\u00900.16 (SEM 0.76; n = 15) in the balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diet group (Griffin 2013). Fatigue One trial reported on events offatigue at six months (RR 0.80, 95% CI\u00c2\u00a00.47 to 1.36, 148 participants, 1 RCT,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 1.38) and at one year (RR 0.91, 95% CI\u00c2\u00a00.49 to 1.71, 148 participants, 1 RCT,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 1.39). Headaches Two trials reported on headaches with no difference over the shorter term (at three months and at six months) (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.26 to 6.02, I2 = 55%, 244 participants, 2 RCTs,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 1.40) or at one year (RR 0.49, 95% CI\u00c2\u00a00.25 to 0.93, 148 participants, 1 RCT,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 1.41). Psychosocial problems (mood disturbances) A single trial measured events of reported anxiety at three months follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up for comparison 1 (RR 1.0, 95% CI 0.07 to 15.26, 60 participants, 1 RCT,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 1.42). One trial reportedtotal mood disturbance scores according to the Profile of Mood States (POMS) at three months (MD 1.91, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00908.06 to 11.88, 118 participants, 1 RCT,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 1.43) and one year (MD 2.87, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00908.48 to 14.22, 118 participants, 1 RCT,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 1.44). \u00c2\u00a0At four months follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up, one trial reported depressive symptoms according to the Beck Depression Inventory (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00900.30, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00901.36 to 0.76, 217 participants, 1 RCT,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 1.45) and anxiety symptoms according to the State\u00e2\u0080\u0090Trait Anxiety Inventory (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00900.20, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00901.44 to 1.04, 217 participants, 1 RCT,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 1.46). Comparison 2. Low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets versus balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets in overweight and obese participants without T2DM (weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phase followed by weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phase) Table 2\u00c2\u00a0presents the effects of low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets compared to balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets (weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phase followed by weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phase) in overweight and obese participants without T2DM on long\u00e2\u0080\u0090term (\u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months) changes in body weight, DBP and LDL cholesterol. Key details about studies in this comparison, including characteristics of the intervention, population, outcomes and method of synthesis are detailed in the OSIS table (Table 10). Primary outcomes The only primary outcome reported by the included trials for comparison 2 was change in body weight at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months. Change in body weight (kg) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months GRADE assessment suggests that low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets that include a weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phase may result in little to no difference in change in body weight over one to two years compared to balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets that include a weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phase in overweight and obese participants without T2DM (low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias and once for imprecision). Over the long term, average weight change from baseline ranged from a reduction of 5.4 kg to an increase of 0.86 kg with low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets and from reductions of 5.5 kg to 1.5 kg with balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets across the three trials that reported this outcome. The meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis of the mean difference in weight reduction between the low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate and balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets demonstrated little to no difference at one to two years (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00900.30 kg, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00902.77 to 2.16, I2 = 0%, 73 participants, 3 RCTs,\u00c2\u00a0low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 2.1). One of the trials had a weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phase of 12 weeks followed by a weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phase of 40 weeks, measuring change in weight at one year. The other two trials measured change in weight at two years, with one trial testing a three\u00e2\u0080\u0090month weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phase followed by a 21\u00e2\u0080\u0090month maintenance phase, and the other trial testing a 6\u00e2\u0080\u0090month weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phase followed by a maintenance\u00e2\u0080\u0090phase that averaged 18 months in duration. This lack of a difference in effect was confirmed by a sensitivity analysis including only the two trials without reported diet/food industry funding (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00900.80 kg, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00903.48 to 1.88, I2 = 0%, 63 participants, 2 RCTs, analysis not shown).\u00c2 Secondary outcomes The only secondary outcomes reported by the included trials for comparison 2 were changes in DBP, SBP, LDL and HDL cholesterol, total cholesterol and triglycerides. \u00c2 Changes in DBP and SBP (mmHg) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months GRADE assessment suggests that the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets that include a weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phase compared to balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets that include a weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phase on change in DBP at one year in overweight and obese participants without T2DM (very low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias and twice for imprecision). One very small trial compared these diets using a weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phase of 12 weeks followed by a maintenance phase of 40 weeks, and reported on changes in DBP (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00906.0 mmHg, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u009017.55 to 5.55, 13 participants, 1 RCT,\u00c2\u00a0very low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 2.2) and SBP\u00c2\u00a0(MD \u00e2\u0080\u009015.0 mmHg, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u009032.36 to 2.36, 13 participants, 1 RCT,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 2.3) at one year. The study reported average DBP reductions from baseline of 4 mmHg in the low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diet group and of 6 mmHg in the balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diet group. For SBP, the study reported an average decrease from baseline of 2 mmHg in the low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate group and an increase of 2 mmHg in the balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate group. Changes in LDL, HDL and total cholesterol and triglycerides (mmol/L) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months Two small trials reported changes in these blood lipids at one to two years. GRADE assessment suggests that the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets that include a weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phase compared to balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets that include a weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phase on change in LDL at one to two years in overweight and obese participants without T2DM (very low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias and twice for imprecision). One trial used a weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phase of 12 weeks followed by a maintenance phase of 40 weeks, and the other trial used a weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phase of six months followed by a maintenance phase of 18 months with changes reported at one and two years, respectively for LDL cholesterol (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00900.08 mmol/L, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00900.44 to 0.28, I2 = 0%, 56 participants, 2 RCTs, very low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 2.4), HDL cholesterol (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00900.05 mmol/L, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00900.37 to 0.28, I2 = 5%, 56 participants, 2 RCTs,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 2.5), total cholesterol (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00900.08 mmol/L, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00900.43 to 0.27, I2 = 0%, 56 participants, 2 RCTs,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 2.6) and triglycerides (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00900.08 mmol/L, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00900.34 to 0.17, I2 = 0%, 56 participants, 2 RCTs,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 2.7).\u00c2 Average LDL cholesterol reductions from baseline ranged from 0.79 mmol/L to 0.2 mmol/L with low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets and from 1.15 mmol/L to 0.14 mmol/L with balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets. For HDL\u00e2\u0080\u0090cholesterol, average changes ranged from a decrease of 0.2 mmol/L to an increase of 0.11 mmol/L with low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets and from increases of 0.03 mmol/L to 0.04 mmol/L with balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets. Average reductions in total cholesterol ranged from 0.24 mmol/L to 0.79 mmol/L with low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets and from 0.17 mmol/L to 1.14 mmol/L with balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets. For triglycerides, average reductions ranged from 0.19 mmol/L to 0.28 mmol/L with low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets and from 0.04 mmol/L to 0.13 mmol/L with balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets. Comparison 3. Low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets versus balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets in overweight and obese participants with T2DM (weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090loss phase only) Table 3\u00c2\u00a0presents the effects of low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets compared to balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets (weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phase only) in overweight and obese participants with T2DM on short\u00e2\u0080\u0090term (three to < 12 months) and long\u00e2\u0080\u0090term (\u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months) changes in body weight, as well as on the number of participants per group with weight loss of at least 5% over the long term, long\u00e2\u0080\u0090term change in DBP, HbA1c and LDL cholesterol, and short\u00e2\u0080\u0090term constipation. Key details about studies in this comparison, including characteristics of the intervention, population, outcomes and method of synthesis can be found in the OSIS table (Table 10). Primary outcomes Change in body weight (kg) at three to < 12 months GRADE assessment suggests that low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets probably result in little to no difference in change in body weight over three to six months compared to balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets in overweight and obese participants with T2DM (moderate\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias). Average weight reductions from baseline over three to six months ranged from 12 kg to 2.41 kg with low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets and from 11.5 kg to 0.33 kg with balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets in the 14 trials reporting this outcome. The meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis showed little to no difference in weight reduction on average between low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate and balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diet groups over three to six months (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00901.26 kg, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00902.44 to \u00e2\u0080\u00900.09, I2 = 47%, 1114 participants, 14 RCTs,\u00c2\u00a0moderate\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 3.1). This lack of a difference in effect was also seen with sensitivity analyses including only trials with 'some concerns' of bias overall (Analysis 3.2, no trials at overall low risk of bias), at low risk of attrition bias (Analysis 3.3) and without reported diet/food industry funding (Analysis 3.4).\u00c2 One included trial also measured change in body weight at three to < 12 months but reported it in an unusable format (Table 9). The funnel plot (Figure 5) suggests that smaller studies may be missing. The mean difference in fixed\u00e2\u0080\u0090effect analysis, which gives less weight to small studies (\u00e2\u0080\u00900.92 kg, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00901.65 to \u00e2\u0080\u00900.19), is similar to the mean difference in random\u00e2\u0080\u0090effects meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis (\u00e2\u0080\u00901.26 kg, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00902.44 to \u00e2\u0080\u00900.09,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 3.1), which gives more weight to smaller studies, suggesting that any small\u00e2\u0080\u0090study effects have little effect on the intervention effect estimate. Four of the 14 trials had follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up at three months from baseline, one trial at four months and nine at six months.\u00c2 Change in body weight (kg) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months GRADE assessment suggests that low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets probably result in little to no difference in change in body weight over one to two years compared to balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets in overweight and obese participants with T2DM (moderate\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias). Average weight reductions from baseline over one to two years in the seven trials reporting this outcome ranged from 8.9 kg to 2 kg with low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets and from 7.4 kg to 1.7 kg with balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets. The meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis showed little to no difference in weight reduction on average between low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate and balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diet groups over one to two years (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00900.33 kg, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00902.13 to 1.46, I2 = 10%, 813 participants, 7 RCTs,\u00c2\u00a0moderate\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 3.5). This lack of a difference in effect was also seen with the sensitivity analysis including only trials\u00c2\u00a0without diet/food industry funding (Analysis 3.6). Other planned sensitivity analyses included only one or two studies and thus were not performed.\u00c2 Of the seven trials, four had follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up at one year and three had follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up at two years. The oldest included trial also measured change in body weight at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months but reported it in an unusable format (Table 9).\u00c2 Number of participants per group with weight loss of at least 5% at three to < 12 months A single small study reported on this outcome at three months and the risk ratio was 1.01 (95% CI 0.77 to 1.33, 45 participants, 1 RCT,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 3.7) with 19 participants in the low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate group and 18 participants in the balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate group achieving at least 5% weight loss from baseline. Number of participants per group with weight loss of at least 5% at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months GRADE assessment suggests that the evidence is very uncertain about whether there is a difference in the number of participants per group with weight loss of at least 5% at one to two years, when comparing low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets with balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets in overweight and obese participants with T2DM (very low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias, once for indirectness and twice for imprecision). Two studies reported on this outcome at one and two years (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.20; I\u00c2\u00b2 = 0; 106 participants, 2 RCTs,\u00c2\u00a0very low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence,\u00c2\u00a0) with the number of participants achieving at least 5% weight loss from baseline ranging from 10 to 22 in the low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing group and 14 to 20 in the balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing group.\u00c2 Secondary outcomes For comparison 3, no studies reported on the number of participants per group with reduction in BMI (kg/m2) of at least 5%. Change in BMI (kg/m2) at three to < 12 months Eleven trials (n = 515 participants) reported on short\u00e2\u0080\u0090term BMI change. Across these trials, average reductions in BMI from baseline ranged from 4 kg/m2 to 0.87 kg/m2 with low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets and from 4 kg/m2 to 0.1 kg/m2 with balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets. We did not pool these results into an overall effect estimate due to substantial heterogeneity (I\u00c2\u00b2 = 57%, Tau\u00c2\u00b2 = 0.56; Chi\u00c2\u00b2 = 23.11, df = 10 (P = 0.01)) but rather presented the individual effect sizes between the two types of diet per study (Analysis 3.9). Three of the 10 trials had follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up at three months, one at four months and seven at six months. Change in BMI (kg/m2) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months Average reductions in BMI from baseline over the long term in the four trials reporting this outcome ranged from 3.3 kg/m2 to 0.8 kg/m2 with low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets and from 2.6 kg/m2 to 0.9 kg/m2 with balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets.\u00c2\u00a0When low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets were compared to balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets, the difference in BMI change on average at one to two years was \u00e2\u0080\u00900.29 kg/m2 (95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00901.06 to 0.48, I2 = 13%, 329 participants, 4 RCTs,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 3.10). Two trials had follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up at one year and the remaining two at two years. Change in DBP (mmHg) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months GRADE assessment suggests that low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets probably result in little to no difference to change in DBP compared to balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets over one to two years in overweight and obese participants with T2DM (moderate\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias). Over one to two years, average changes from baseline in DBP ranged from a reduction of 5 mmHg to an increase 3 mmHg in low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diet groups and from a reduction of 6 mmHg to an increase of 4.3 mmHg in balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diet groups across the six trials reporting on this outcome. The meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis of the mean difference in change in DBP between the low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate and balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets demonstrated little to no difference at one to two years (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00900.28 mmHg 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00901.84 to 1.28, I2 = 0%, 631 participants, 6 RCTs, moderate\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 3.11). Three of the six trials had follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up at one year and the other three at two years. Change in SBP (mmHg) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months Average change in SBP from baseline in the six trials reporting this outcome ranged from a reduction of 9 mmHg to an increase of 3.2 mmHg with low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets and from a reduction of 11 mmHg to an increase of 2.4 mmHg with balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets over one to two years of follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up. The mean difference in change in SBP at one to two years was 0.32 mmHg (95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00902.30 to 2.93, I2 = 0%, 629 participants, 6 RCTs,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 3.12). Three of the six trials had follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up at one year and the other three at two years. Change in HbA1c (%) at 12 months GRADE assessment suggests that low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets probably result in little to no difference to change in HbA1c compared to balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets over one to two years in overweight and obese participants with T2DM (moderate\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias). Average change in HbA1c from baseline over one to two years ranged from a reduction of 2% to an increase of 0.1% with low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets and from a reduction of 1.8% to an increase of 0.2% with balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets across the six trials that reported this outcome. The meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis of the mean difference in change in HbA1c between the low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate and balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets demonstrated little to no difference at one to two years (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00900.14% 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00900.38 to 0.10, I2 = 31%, 668 participants, 6 RCTs,\u00c2\u00a0moderate\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 3.13). Four of the six trials had follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up at one year and the other two had follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up at two years. One included trial also measured change in HbA1c in diabetic participants only at one year but reported it in an unusable format (Table 9). Change in LDL cholesterol (mmol/L) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months GRADE assessment suggests that low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets probably result in little to no difference in change in LDL\u00e2\u0080\u0090cholesterol over one to two years compared to balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets in overweight and obese participants with T2DM (moderate\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias). Average change from baseline over one to two years across the seven trials reporting on change in LDL cholesterol ranged from a reduction of 0.61 mmol/L to an increase of 0.2 mmol/L in low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diet groups and from a reduction of 0.55 mmol/L to an increase of 0.1 mmol/L in balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diet groups. The meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis of the mean difference in change in LDL cholesterol between the low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate and balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets demonstrated little to no difference at one to two years (MD 0.12 mmol/L, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00900.03 to 0.26, I2 = 34%, 753 participants, 7 RCTs,\u00c2\u00a0moderate\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 3.14). Four of the seven trials had follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up at one year; the other three had follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up at two years. Change in HDL cholesterol (mmol/L) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months Over one to two years, average change from baseline across the seven trials reporting on change in HDL cholesterol ranged from a reduction of 0.03 mmol/L to an increase of 0.23 mmol/L in low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diet groups and from a reduction of 0.13 mmol/L to an increase of 0.11 mmol/L in balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diet groups. We did not pool these results into an overall effect estimate due to substantial heterogeneity (I\u00c2\u00b2 = 67%, Tau\u00c2\u00b2 = 0.01; Chi\u00c2\u00b2 = 18.34, df = 6 (P = 0.005)) but rather presented the individual effect sizes between the low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate and balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets per study (Analysis 3.15). Four of the seven trials had follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up at one year and the other three had follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up at two years. Change in non\u00e2\u0080\u0090HDL cholesterol (mmol/L) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months Two studies reported on this outcome at one and two years and the mean difference in non\u00e2\u0080\u0090HDL cholesterol was 0.09 mmol/L (95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00900.39 to 0.58, I2 = 0%, 159 participants, 2 RCTs,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 3.16) with average increases in non\u00e2\u0080\u0090HDL ranging from 0.13 mmol/L to 0.2 mmol/L in the low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing group and from 0.1 mmol/L to 0.17 mmol/L in the balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing group.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2 Change in total cholesterol (mmol/L) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months Average change from baseline over one to two years across the seven trials reporting on change in total cholesterol ranged from a reduction of 0.88 mmol/L to an increase of 0.2 mmol/L with low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets and from reductions of 0.96 mmol/L to 0.1 mmol/L with balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets. The mean difference in change in total cholesterol at one to two years was 0.21 mmol/L (95% CI 0.06 to 0.37, I2 = 25%, 838 participants, 7 RCTs,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 3.17). Four of the seven trials had follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up at one year and the other three trials at two years. Change in triglycerides (mmol/L) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months Over one to two years, average change in triglycerides from baseline triglycerides ranged from reductions of 1.52 mmol/L to 0.1 mmol/L in low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diet groups and from a reduction of 1.46 mmol/L to an increase of 0.16 mmol/L in balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diet groups across the seven trials reporting on this outcome. We did not pool these results into an overall effect estimate due to substantial heterogeneity (I\u00c2\u00b2 = 75%, Tau\u00c2\u00b2 = 0.07; Chi\u00c2\u00b2 = 23.97, df = 6 (P = 0.0005) but rather presented the individual effect sizes between the low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate and balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets per study (Analysis 3.18). Five of the seven trials had follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up at one year and the remaining two trials at two years. Another trial reported change in triglycerides at two years as medians and interquartile ranges as the data were not normally distributed (Krebs 2012).\u00c2 Participant\u00e2\u0080\u0090reported adverse effects Participant\u00e2\u0080\u0090reported adverse effects were scantily reported by three included trials for comparison 3, with all outcomes except short\u00e2\u0080\u0090term constipation being reported only by single trials. All adverse effect outcomes reported in these trials had very few events or mean differences close to 0 and small total sample sizes.\u00c2 Gastrointestinal GRADE assessment suggests that the evidence is very uncertain about whether there is a difference in the number of participants per group with constipation at three to six months when comparing low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets with balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets in overweight and obese participants with T2DM (very low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias and twice for imprecision).\u00c2 The meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis of the risk ratio of the number of participants per group reporting constipation at six months was 1.37 (95% CI 0.86 to 2.18, I2 = 0%, 177 participants, 2 RCTs,\u00c2\u00a0very low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 3.19) when comparing low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate and balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diet groups. One included trial also measured constipation at three months but reported data in an unusable format (Table 9). One trial reported constipation at one year (RR 2.71, 95% CI 0.11 to 64.65, 78 participants, 1 RCT,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 3.20). One trial reported on events of diarrhoea at six months (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.84, 84 participants, 1 RCT,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 3.21). Another trial (using an adaption of the Health Symptom Checklist) (Saslow 2017a) reported \"no statistically significant changes\" for diarrhoea at three months (data were not reported or provided when authors were contacted), and also reported heartburn symptoms at three months (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00900.30, 95% CI\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00900.66 to 0.06, 33 participants, 1 RCT,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 3.22). Appetite One trial reported on appetite change from baseline at three months using the three\u00e2\u0080\u0090factor eating questionnaire (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00900.70, 95% CI\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00903.03 to 1.63, 33 participants, 1 RCT,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 3.23). Headaches One trial reported on events of headaches at six months (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.78, 84 participants, 1 RCT,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 3.24). Another trial reported no statistical difference between participants in the low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diet group and the balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090diet group for headaches at three months (used adaptation of the Health Symptom Checklist), but data were not reported or provided when authors were contacted (Saslow 2017a). Psychosocial problems (mood disturbances) \u00c2\u00a0At three months follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up, one trial reported depressive symptoms according to the 20\u00e2\u0080\u0090item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES\u00e2\u0080\u0090D) (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00900.20, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00909.20 to 8.80, 33 participants, 1 RCT,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 3.25). Comparison 4. Low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets versus balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets in overweight and obese participants with T2DM (weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phase followed by weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phase) Table 4\u00c2\u00a0presents the effects of low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets compared to balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets (weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phase followed by weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phase) in overweight and obese participants with T2DM on short\u00e2\u0080\u0090term (three to <12 months) and long\u00e2\u0080\u0090term (\u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months) changes in body weight, DBP, HbA1c and LDL cholesterol, and short\u00e2\u0080\u0090term constipation. Key details about studies in this comparison, including characteristics of the intervention, population, outcomes and method of synthesis are detailed in the OSIS table (Table 10). Primary outcomes The only primary outcomes reported by the included trials for comparison 4 were change in body weight at three to < 12 months and change in body weight at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months.\u00c2 Change in body weight (kg) at three to < 12 months GRADE assessment suggests that low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets that include a weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phase may result in little to no difference in change in body weight at six months compared to balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets that include a weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phase in overweight and obese participants with T2DM (low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias and once for imprecision). The single study reporting change in weight at six months found average weight reductions of 1 kg with the low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diet and 0.2 kg with the balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diet. The mean difference in weight reduction between the two diets in this study demonstrated little to no difference at six months (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00900.80 kg, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00902.46 to 0.86, 61 participants, 1 RCT,\u00c2\u00a0low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 4.1).

Average changes in weight from baseline over one to two years in the three trials reporting this outcome ranged from a reduction of 2.23 kg to an increase 1.3 kg with low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets and from reductions of 2.17 kg to 1.5 kg with balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets.

All trials had high risk of attrition bias and overall bias, and had diet/food industry funding, precluding sensitivity analyses.\u00c2 Secondary outcomes The secondary outcomes reported by the included trials for comparison 4 were change in BMI at three to < 12 months, change in BMI at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months, change in HbA1c, DBP, SBP, LDL and HDL cholesterol, total cholesterol and triglycerides. \u00c2 Change in BMI (kg/m2) at three to < 12 months One trial compared these diets using a three\u00e2\u0080\u0090month weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phase followed by a three\u00e2\u0080\u0090month weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phase and reported average BMI reductions from baseline of 0.3 kg/m2 in the low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate group and 0.01 kg/m2 in the balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate group after six months. The meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis of the mean difference in BMI change at six months was \u00e2\u0080\u00900.29 kg/m2 (95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00900.83 to 0.25, 61 participants, 1 RCT,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 4.3).\u00c2 Change in BMI (kg/m2) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months The single trial reporting on this outcome in comparison 4 found average BMI reductions from baseline of 0.75 kg/m2 with the low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diet and 0.63 kg/m2 with the balanced diet after 18 months (six\u00e2\u0080\u0090month weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phase followed by 12\u00e2\u0080\u0090month weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phase). The mean difference in BMI change at 18 months in this trial was \u00e2\u0080\u00900.12 kg/m2 (95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00900.86 to 0.62, 47 participants, 1 RCT,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 4.4). Changes in DBP and SBP (mmHg) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months GRADE assessment suggests that the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets that include a weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phase compared to balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets that include a weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phase on change in DBP at one year in overweight and obese participants with T2DM (very low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias and twice for imprecision). One trial compared these diets in comparison 4 using a three\u00e2\u0080\u0090month weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phase followed by a nine\u00e2\u0080\u0090month maintenance phase, and reported on changes in DBP (MD \u00e2\u0080\u00900.44 mmHg, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00904.89 to 4.01, 99 participants, 1 RCT,\u00c2\u00a0very low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 4.5) and SBP\u00c2\u00a0(MD \u00e2\u0080\u00904.27 mmHg, 95% CI \u00e2\u0080\u00908.74 to 0.20, 99 participants, 1 RCT,\u00c2\u00a0Analysis 4.6) at one year. The study reported average DBP increases from a baseline of 0.21 mmHg in the low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diet group and of 0.65 mmHg in the balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diet group at one year. For SBP, the study reported an average decrease from baseline of 5.03 mmHg in the low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate group and 0.76 mmHg in the balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate group. Change in HbA1c (%) at 12 months GRADE assessment suggests that low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets that include a weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phase may result in little to no difference in change in HbA1c over one to two years compared to balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets that include a weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phase in overweight and obese participants with T2DM (low\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias and once for imprecision). Average changes in HbA1c from baseline over one to two years in the three trials reporting this outcome ranged from a reduction of 0.39% to an increase of 0.3% with low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets and from a reduction of 0.37% to an increase of 0.4% with balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets.

Change in LDL, HDL and total cholesterol and triglycerides (mmol/L) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months Two trials reported changes in these blood lipids at one to two years.

Counselling sessions were provided at visits at baseline, 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks. The duration of sessions was between 45 to 60 minutes. The dietician provided detailed information on the meal plan and keeping daily food logs.Strategies to improve or maintain fidelity; tailoring and modification: Participants received a list of counselling appointments at baseline, and were reminded of sessions by phone call, text or email before each visit. The body weight, waist circumference and dietary intake of participants were reviewed at each visit; dietary adjustments were made if necessary. The dietitian reviewed completed dietary checklists and three\u00e2\u0080\u0090day food records.

Low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets ad libitum diets may be at least as effective as traditional low\u00e2\u0080\u0090fat, high\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets for weight loss up to one year. The evidence to date is limited.What (materials)? Dr Atkins' New Diet Revolution (Atkins 2002).What (procedures)? Participants in this diet group aimed for the consumption of 20 g/d or less of carbohydrate for 'induction' (usually 2\u00e2\u0080\u00903 months) and 50 g/d or less of carbohydrate for the subsequent 'ongoing weight loss' phase. Participants were assigned their diet book, attended regular classes covering the contents of the book and were administered unannounced dietary intake and energy expenditure questionnaires.Who provided? A registered dietitian led the classes and covered a portion of the book's contents per session so it would be complete at the end of the contact period. Unannounced dietary and exercise data were collected by persons trained and certified by the Nutrition Coordinating Centre.How and where? Class sessions were held face\u00e2\u0080\u0090to\u00e2\u0080\u0090face and in groups, location NR. Unannounced dietary and exercise data were collected by telephone.When and how much? Class sessions were one hour each and occurred every week for eight weeks. Unannounced dietary and exercise data were collected at baseline and at 2, 6 and 12 months. This entailed recall of three days (two weekdays and one weekend day, preferably non\u00e2\u0080\u0090consecutive) of dietary intake as well as seven days of physical activity.Strategies to improve or maintain fidelity; tailoring and modification: Strategies included email and telephone reminders for appointments, email or telephone contact from staff between the 2\u00e2\u0080\u0090 and 6\u00e2\u0080\u0090month and between the 6\u00e2\u0080\u0090 and 12\u00e2\u0080\u0090month data collection points, and incentive payments of $25, $50, and $75 for completing the 2\u00e2\u0080\u0090, 6\u00e2\u0080\u0090, and 12\u00e2\u0080\u0090month data collection, respectively. A \u00e2\u0080\u0098Food Amounts Booklet\u00e2\u0080\u0099 was used to assist participants with portion size estimation during dietary recalls. Unannounced dietary and exercise recalls, group sessions, measurement of body weight as part of study outcomesExtent of intervention fidelity: Dietary adherence scores calculated as the difference between reported and recommended daily carbohydrate intake (< = 20 g carbohydrate per day during the first two months; and <= 50 g carbohydrate per day for the subsequent 10 months), using the average of three non\u00e2\u0080\u0090consecutive 24\u00e2\u0080\u0090h dietary recalls at each time point. A lower score reflects better adherence. Adherence score, means (SD): at 2 months, 35.2 (32.7); at 6 months, 62.6 (64.7); at 12 months, 85.8 (70.5). In all 4 diet groups, 85% to 89% of participants attended at least 75% of their assigned classes (>= 6 of 8).

This diet is based on national American guidelines. Such national guidelines have been challenged by proponents of low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets, but limited evidence is currently available.What (materials)? Participants were instructed to follow a prudent diet that included 55% to 60% energy from carbohydrate and less than 10%energy from saturated fat, caloric restriction, increased exercise, and behaviour modification strategies. The LEARN program is intended to be a 16\u00e2\u0080\u0090week programme and, therefore, the 8 weeks of guidance in this study.

Also, during the 4 months of nutritional intervention, nutritionists conducted motivational telephone calls with each participant in order to increase the adherence to the dietary advice based on previous trials.Extent of intervention fidelity: The targets of macronutrient intake were not fully achieved among subjects of the low\u00e2\u0080\u0090fat diet.Concomitant interventions: NR\t \tOutcomes\tChange in body weight (kg) at 3 to < 12 months: YesChange in body weight (kg) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoNumber of participants with 5% weight loss from baseline at 3 to < 12 months: NoNumber of participants with 5% weight loss from baseline at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoChange in BMI (kg/m2) at 3 to 12 months: YesChange in BMI (kg/m2) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoNumber of participants with 5% BMI reduction from baseline at 3 to 12 months: NoNumber of participants with 5% BMI reduction from baseline at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoChange in DBP (mmHg) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoChange in SBP (mmHg) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoAll\u00e2\u0080\u0090cause mortality at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoCardiovascular mortality at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoNon\u00e2\u0080\u0090fatal myocardial infarction at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoNon\u00e2\u0080\u0090fatal stroke at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoDiagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoChange in HbA1c (%) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoChange in LDL (mmol/L) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoChange in HDL (mmol/L) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoChange in non\u00e2\u0080\u0090HDL (mmom/L) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoChange in total cholesterol (TC) (mmol/L) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoChange in triglycerides (or triacylglycerides) (TG) (mmol/L) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoParticipant\u00e2\u0080\u0090reported adverse effects: Yes\t \tNotes\tNumber and type of records(s): journal articleTrial acronym/name: ObekitTrial funded by: Government of Navarra (ADITECH; Obekit project), Linea Especial (University of Navarra; LE/97) and CIBERobn/RETICS schedules (Insituto de Salud Carlos III)Declaration of interest: \"The authors declare no conflict of interest.\" Griffin 2013 Study characteristics\t \tMethods\tReview comparison(s) addressed by this study: 1Study design: RCT, parallel, number of centres NRTrial registry number: ACTRN12609000307202Total number of trial arms: 2Year trial started: NRSample size calculation:Outcome(s) used for sample size calculation: YesDuration of run\u00e2\u0080\u0090in period (weeks): Weight differenceWhat was the duration of the weight loss phase: 12 monthsWhat was the duration of the weight maintenance phase: NAOther notes about methods: NA\t \tParticipants\tCountry and setting: NR;\u00c2\u00a0likely Australia based on authors and funderEligibility criteria: Participants were otherwise healthy women aged 18 to 25 years with BMI > 27.5 kg/m2.

A hypocaloric high\u00e2\u0080\u0090protein diet may result in the suppression of hunger and induction of satiety, resulting in weight loss. It may also result in a positive nitrogen balance, therefore assisting in the maintenance of lean body mass, compared to a hypocaloric high\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diet. Furthermore, it may have positive effects on metabolic parameters, such as b\u00e2\u0080\u0090cell function, cardiovascular risk factors, oxidative stress, and lipid peroxidation.What (materials)? At baseline, an individualised weekly food diary (which included the participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s preferences) was printed and given to each subject with instructions for recording all food intake on a daily basis. Weekly provision of fresh, prepackaged, and frozen foods for the duration of the study. Most of the entrees for the diet were frozen entrees purchased directly from the manufacturer. The diet included 1 cup of frozen vegetables at both lunch and dinner. Snacks in between meals included shakes and meal bars. Participants were given all food needed to meet their dietary assignment for the duration of the study. All food was dispensed by the dietitian at the CRC on a weekly basis to each participant. An individualised weekly food diary (which included the participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s preferences) was printed and given to each subject with instructions for recording all food intake on a daily basis.What (procedures)? High\u00e2\u0080\u0090protein (40% carbohydrates, 30% fat, and 30% protein) hypocaloric diet for 6 months. Weight reduction caloric needs were established for each individual by subtracting 500 kcal/day from their calculated maintenance needs established by REE. Weight loss of 1\u00e2\u0080\u00932 lbs weekly was targeted. On average, an 1800 kcal/day diet for a 70\u00e2\u0080\u0090kg individual was used to achieve adequate weight loss. If a subject reached a plateau and did not lose weight for two consecutive weeks, calories were reduced by an additional 200 kcal or to a minimum of 1200 kcal/day. Caloric adjustments were made by altering the amount of supplement bars and/or shakes. Since these were very similar to the nutrient composition of each diet, they could be easily taken out of the diet to reduce calories but maintain adequate nutrient composition. The study diets provided more than the recommended amount of calcium (1000 mg/day) for women 20\u00e2\u0080\u009350 years of age by providing an average of 1725 mg for HC and 1684 mg for HP diets. Both HP and HC diets were designed to minimise participant health risks. Dietary fat sources focussed on monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, i.e. plant oils, semi\u00e2\u0080\u0090liquid margarine, and nuts; dietary carbohydrate sources emphasised whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and legumes; and dietary protein sources included lean meats, fish, chicken, eggs, and nonfat dairy foods, i.e. fat\u00e2\u0080\u0090free milk and low\u00e2\u0080\u0090fat cheese, consistent with American Diabetes Association and Institute of Medicine guidelines.Who provided?

Substituting protein for carbohydrate while maintaining reduced total fat may have particular benefits in type 2 diabetes. High\u00e2\u0080\u0090protein diets promote weight loss, maintain lean body mass and improve lipid and glycaemic profiles in obese non\u00e2\u0080\u0090diabetic individuals. Studies specifically in type 2 diabetes are limited, are generally short, often using very intensive interventions and/or providing a significant proportion of participants\u00e2\u0080\u0099 food, making the translation of the findings to a general population difficult. Therefore the specific long\u00e2\u0080\u0090term effect of increasing protein intake in individuals with type 2 diabetes in a free\u00e2\u0080\u0090living situation, using an intervention that can be realistically implemented, requires further investigation.What (materials)?

Throughout the 12\u00e2\u0080\u0090mo study, participants were required to attend a 1\u00e2\u0080\u0090h meeting each week.Strategies to improve or maintain fidelity; tailoring and modification: Group meeting with the research dietitians who provided diet information, answered questions, and reviewed diet records for treatment compliance. Participants were required to report 2 3\u00e2\u0080\u0090d weighed food records during the baseline period prior to assignment to diet groups. Nutrient intakes were evaluated as mean daily intakes from the 3\u00e2\u0080\u0090d weighed records using Nutritionist Pro software (First DataBank) for treatment compliance. Compliance with dietary protocols was also monitored with plasma TAG at 0, 4,and 12 mo as a marker of carbohydrate intake and 24\u00e2\u0080\u0090h urinary urea at 0, 4, and 8 mo as a marker of protein intake. High degree of nutrition monitoring throughout the 12 months with weekly meetings that included monitoring body weight, weighed food records, and diet instruction, 3\u00e2\u0080\u0090d weighed food records, which were reviewed each week with feedback to participants about diet compliance. Any participant with an unexcused absence at a weekly meeting was called by a staff dietitian to promote attendance and any participant with 3 consecutive absences was asked to define their participation status in the study.Extent of intervention fidelity: All participants completing data collection participated in < 75% of meetings, including weigh\u00e2\u0080\u0090ins and diet records. Compliance with dietary protocols was also monitored with plasma TAG at 0, 4, and 12 mo as a marker of carbohydrate intake and 24\u00e2\u0080\u0090h urinary urea at 0, 4, and 8 mo as a marker of protein intake.Concomitant interventions: Participants were excluded if they were on lipid\u00e2\u0080\u0090lowering medications, oral steroids or antidepression medication.\t \tOutcomes\tChange in body weight (kg) at 3 to < 12 months: YesChange in body weight (kg) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: YesNumber of participants with 5% weight loss from baseline at 3 to < 12 months: NoNumber of participants with 5% weight loss from baseline at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoChange in BMI (kg/m2) at 3 to 12 months: NoChange in BMI (kg/m2) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoNumber of participants with 5% BMI reduction from baseline at 3 to 12 months: NoNumber of participants with 5% BMI reduction from baseline at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoChange in DBP (mmHg) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoChange in SBP (mmHg) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoAll\u00e2\u0080\u0090cause mortality at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoCardiovascular mortality at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoNon\u00e2\u0080\u0090fatal myocardial infarction at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoNon\u00e2\u0080\u0090fatal stroke at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoDiagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoChange in HbA1c (%) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoChange in LDL (mmol/L) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: YesChange in HDL (mmol/L) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: YesChange in non\u00e2\u0080\u0090HDL (mmom/L) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoChange in total cholesterol (TC) (mmol/L) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoChange in triglycerides (or triacylglycerides) (TG) (mmol/L) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: YesParticipant\u00e2\u0080\u0090reported adverse effects: No\t \tNotes\tNumber and type of records(s): journal articleTrial acronym/name: NoneTrial funded by: National Cattlemen's Beef Association, Beef Checkoff and Kraft FoodsDeclaration of interest: \"D.

Unclear if Chinese people, given their habitually high\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate consumption, are able to adapt to a LC diet for weight control. This study investigated the adherence to a LC diet on weight loss and its effects on the improvement of cardiovascular risk factors among overweight or obese Chinese women, in comparison with an energy\u00e2\u0080\u0090restricted (ER) diet.What (materials)? \"All experimental meals were prepared in a designated kitchen at the hospital. All participants received their experimental meals every day including weekends.\"What (procedures)? The LC diet was designed to provide 20 g carbohydrate daily in the first week, with a gradual increase to 120 g, by adding 10 g weekly until the 11th week, since carbohydrate intake up to 120 g/d has been reported to be sufficient to benefit weight control and metabolic profiles. In addition, a ketogenic diet with no more than 50 g carbohydrate might be rather difficult for a population with a habitually high\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate intake. Carbohydrate\u00e2\u0080\u0090rich foods, such as white rice, steamed bread and tubers, were substituted with fish, poultry and plant oil. In addition to three meals, snacks, including boiled eggs (with or without yolk), cucumbers and tomatoes, were also provided ad libitum any time from 06.00 to 17.30 hours each day. Participants were encouraged to consume every meal in a designated dining room within the building where they worked. Sometimes the participants also consumed meals close to their working place in the hospital if they had a short lunch break. In this case, the participants were required to report to dietitians about any leftovers or intake of foods other than the experimental meals. At the beginning of the intervention, participants were instructed to maintain their usual physical activity levels throughout the study; those in the LC diet group were particularly recommended to drink plenty of plain water, to compensate for possible water loss in ketosis.Who provided?

Nitrogen excretion in urine (NU) was used as a biomarker for protein intake, with three 24\u00e2\u0080\u0090h urine samples collected at baseline and after 6 and 24 months. The para\u00e2\u0080\u0090aminobenzoic acid (PABA) method 14 was used to verify the completeness of the urine collections. NU was determined using the Kjeldahl technique with a Kjeltec analyser (model NMKL nr 6, Eurofins Food & Agro AB, Lidk\u00c3\u00b6ping, Sweden).Extent of intervention fidelity: The PD group reported a significantly lower intake (E% and g/d) of carbohydrates, higher intake (E% and g/d) of protein, MUFA, PUFA, cholesterol, and higher total fat (E%), MUFA:SFA and PUFA:SFA ratios compared to the NNR group. The PD group reported a more pronounced change in the ratio (E%) protein:carbohydrates:total fat from baseline to 6 and 24 months (17:46:33, 23:29:44, 22:34:40; respectively) compared to the NNR group (17:45:35, 19:48:32, 17:43:34; respectively). Target intakes were not fully achieved; the PD did not reach the target amounts of percent energy of protein (30 E%) at 6 and 24 months, and the NNR group did not reach the target amounts of carbohydrates (55\u00e2\u0080\u009060%).Concomitant interventions: NR\t \tOutcomes\tChange in body weight (kg) at 3 to < 12 months: YesChange in body weight (kg) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: YesNumber of participants with 5% weight loss from baseline at 3 to < 12 months: NoNumber of participants with 5% weight loss from baseline at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoChange in BMI (kg/m2) at 3 to 12 months: YesChange in BMI (kg/m2) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: YesNumber of participants with 5% BMI reduction from baseline at 3 to 12 months: NoNumber of participants with 5% BMI reduction from baseline at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoChange in DBP (mmHg) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: YesChange in SBP (mmHg) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: YesAll\u00e2\u0080\u0090cause mortality at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoCardiovascular mortality at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoNon\u00e2\u0080\u0090fatal myocardial infarction at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoNon\u00e2\u0080\u0090fatal stroke at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoDiagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoChange in HbA1c (%) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoChange in LDL (mmol/L) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: YesChange in HDL (mmol/L) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: YesChange in non\u00e2\u0080\u0090HDL (mmom/L) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoChange in total cholesterol (TC) (mmol/L) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: YesChange in triglycerides (or triacylglycerides) (TG) (mmol/L) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: YesParticipant\u00e2\u0080\u0090reported adverse effects: No\t \tNotes\tNumber and type of records(s): journal articleTrial acronym/name: KNOTATrial funded by: The Swedish Council for Working Life and Social Research (grants 2006\u00e2\u0080\u00900699 and 2010\u00e2\u0080\u00900398), the Swedish Research Council (grant K2011\u00e2\u0080\u009012237\u00e2\u0080\u009015\u00e2\u0080\u00906), the Swedish Heart and Lung Foundation, the County Council of V\u00c3\u00a4sterbotten and Ume\u00c3\u00a5 University, SwedenDeclaration of interest: \"The authors declare no conflict of interest.\"Author contacted, but requested information not provided.

The diet was included as a comparator for a standard\u00e2\u0080\u0090protein diet with branched\u00e2\u0080\u0090chain amino acids (BCAAs) supplementation. High\u00e2\u0080\u0090protein diets are stated as reducing the loss of lean mass during weight loss, but they are expensive.What (materials)?

Accelerometers were provided to participants at week 0 and week 8 visits.What (procedures)? The high\u00e2\u0080\u0090protein diet consisted of 16 weeks following a diet with a macronutrient composition of 30% fat, 43% carbohydrate and 27% protein; with placebo supplementation (as opposed to BCAAs).

Web\u00e2\u0080\u0090based self\u00e2\u0080\u0090monitoring was completed by participants.When and how much? The duration of the intervention was two years. During the first six months, group sessions lasting one hour were provided three out of every four weeks; and thereafter two our of every four weeks for the remainder of the intervention. Individual sessions with dietitians, lasting 30 minutes each, were scheduled every eight weeks for the duration of the intervention. Food and beverage diaries and web\u00e2\u0080\u0090based self\u00e2\u0080\u0090monitoring of food intake was done daily.Strategies to improve or maintain fidelity; tailoring and modification: Participants were instructed to record their food and beverage intake in a daily food diary and in a Web based self\u00e2\u0080\u0090monitoring tool that provided information on how closely their daily food intake met the goals for macronutrients and energy. Behavioural counselling was integrated into the group and individual sessions to promote adherence to the assigned diets (e.g. behavioural strategies such as goal\u00e2\u0080\u0090setting, problem\u00e2\u0080\u0090solving). Self\u00e2\u0080\u0090monitoring indicated how well food intake corresponded with the prescribed macronutrient and energy intakes, regular weight monitoring; team members praised participants for success. Dietary intake of participants was assessed by 24\u00e2\u0080\u0090hour recalls at 6 months and 2 years (three telephone interviews within a 3\u00e2\u0080\u0090week period, 2 weekdays and a weekend day) in a 50% random sample selected. Participation in exercise was monitored by questionnaire (at 12 and 24 months follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up) and by the online self\u00e2\u0080\u0090monitoring tool.Extent of intervention fidelity: Attendance at individual counselling was higher than for group counselling (64.3 versus 53.8% overall, 69.5 versus 55.3% in intervention arm). Adherence data from subsample (n = 177): % Individual sessions attended, means (SD): 69.5 (30.7); % group sessions attended, means (SD): 55.3 (20.0); % of days with completed food entries, means (SD): 60.1 (31.9); % of days with physical activity entries, means (SD): 29.8 (22.4); % discrepancy (kcal goal), means (SD): \u00e2\u0080\u00909.5 (11.4); % discrepancy (protein goal), means (SD): \u00e2\u0080\u009014.5 (13.2); % discrepancy (fat goal), means (SD): \u00e2\u0080\u009013.8 (14.8); % discrepancy (carbohydrate goal), means (SD): \u00e2\u0080\u00901.4 (13.2)Concomitant interventions: Use of medicines at baseline: Antihypertensive medication, n/N (%) : 61/201 (30%); lipid\u00e2\u0080\u0090lowering medication, n/N (%): 31/201 (15%)Control diet:Name (as reported) and brief description: Low\u00e2\u0080\u0090fat average\u00e2\u0080\u0090protein, 20% fat, 15% protein and 65% carbohydrates; 90 min of moderate physical exercise.

Many patients with type 2 diabetes struggle to adhere to calorie\u00e2\u0080\u0090restricted diets. In the United States and Europe there is much debate about the use of low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets in the treatment of type 2 diabetes.

They did, however, report that adherence was good. Carbohydrate intake from baseline to six months decreased from 223.2 (52.4) to 148.8 (31.3) g/day.Concomitant interventions: Four participants (13.3%) were on basal supported oral therapy, and 23.3% on intensive insulin therapy (basal insulin at 17 (11) units/day and bolus insulin at 16 (18) units/day).

Thereafter $40 food vouchers were given to participants for the next 16 weeks. Scales for weighing food were provided.What (procedures)? Subjects were instructed to follow a high\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate low\u00e2\u0080\u0090fat diet and were given key foods for eight weeks and food vouchers for the following 16 weeks to assist with compliance. Semiquantitative food records were kept and food was weighed. Individual consultations with a dietitian comprised dietary advice and meal planning. Three\u00e2\u0080\u0090day food records were kept every two weeks and dietary composition was determined. Dietary intake was assessed by food frequency questionnaire.Who provided? Qualified dietitians provided individual consultations.How and where? Face\u00e2\u0080\u0090to\u00e2\u0080\u0090face consultations with dieticians at a clinic and food records kept by participants at homeWhen and how much? During the course of the 24\u00e2\u0080\u0090week intervention subjects attended the clinic fortnightly for eight weeks and monthly thereafter. Key foods were provided on a fortnightly basis for eight weeks. Food vouchers were provided for the remaining 16 weeks on a monthly basis. Food records were completed daily and individual consultations with dietitians occurred during clinic visits. Three\u00e2\u0080\u0090day food records were done every two weeks and food frequency questionnaires were completed at baseline and 24 weeks.Strategies to improve or maintain fidelity; tailoring and modification: Keeping of food records and analysis thereof for dietary composition, weighing of food, regular determination of body weight and plasma ketones as study outcome, regular meetings with dietitian, provision of key foods and food vouchers. Dietary advice was individualised. Subjects in the HCLF diet were asked to restrict saturated fat intake to < 10 g/day for the study duration.Extent of intervention fidelity: High level of dietary compliance found according to dietary dataConcomitant interventions: In the total group, 17.0% were taking estrogen (12.5% HRT and 4.5% oral contraceptive), 30.7% were on antihypertensive medications, 20.5% were taking lipid\u00e2\u0080\u0090lowering medication and none were taking hypoglycemic medication; no significant differences between medication use in the two trial arms\t \tOutcomes\tChange in body weight (kg) at 3 to < 12 months: YesChange in body weight (kg) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: YesNumber of participants with 5% weight loss from baseline at 3 to < 12 months: YesNumber of participants with 5% weight loss from baseline at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: YesChange in BMI (kg/m2) at 3 to 12 months: YesChange in BMI (kg/m2) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: YesNumber of participants with 5% BMI reduction from baseline at 3 to 12 months: NoNumber of participants with 5% BMI reduction from baseline at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoChange in DBP (mmHg) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: YesChange in SBP (mmHg) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: YesAll\u00e2\u0080\u0090cause mortality at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoCardiovascular mortality at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoNon\u00e2\u0080\u0090fatal myocardial infarction at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoNon\u00e2\u0080\u0090fatal stroke at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoDiagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoChange in HbA1c (%) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoChange in LDL (mmol/L) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: YesChange in HDL (mmol/L) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: YesChange in non\u00e2\u0080\u0090HDL (mmol/L) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: YesChange in total cholesterol (TC) (mmol/L) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: YesChange in triglycerides (or triacylglycerides) (TG) (mmol/L) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: YesParticipant\u00e2\u0080\u0090reported adverse effects: Yes\t \tNotes\tNumber and type of records(s): journal articleTrial acronym/name: NoneTrial funded by: National Heart Foundation of Australia and National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia project grantsDeclaration of interest: \"None of the funding agencies played a role in the conception, design, or conduct of the study collection, management, analysis, and interpretation of the data or in the preparation, review, and approval of the manuscript.\"Author contacted, but requested information not provided.

The aim of this study was therefore to compare the effects of isocaloric HP and HC diets, combined with regular moderate intensity exercise, on glycaemic control and cardiometabolic risk factors in overweight and obese adults with T2DM initially following 12 weeks of active weight loss, and then to re\u00e2\u0080\u0090evaluate the outcomes following 12 weeks of energy balance without the influence of weight change. By including an exercise component, we are able to determine the effects of the dietary patterns when administrated as part of a holistic lifestyle intervention as recommended in the management of T2DM.What (materials)? Core study foods corresponding to their assigned dietary patternWhat (procedures)? HP diet being 32% of total energy as protein, 33% carbohydrate, and 30% total fat (< 10% as saturated fat).

Compared to the HC group, the HP group consumed significantly more protein and less carbohydrate and fibre (P < 0.05 for each nutrient) for each phase. As expected, the total fat intake in the HP diet was higher than the HC diet as a result of larger meat portions and the inclusion of reduced\u00e2\u0080\u0090fat cheese and almonds, however both groups met the dietary recommendations for saturated fat intake (< 10% of energy intake).Concomitant interventions: 58% metformin; 19% insulin; 52% lipid\u00e2\u0080\u0090lowering medication; 61% antihypertensive medicationControl diet:Name (as reported) and brief description: Higher\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diet.

As expected, the total fat intake in the HP diet was higher than the HC diet as a result of larger meat portions and the inclusion of reduced\u00e2\u0080\u0090fat cheese and almonds, however both groups met the dietary recommendations for saturated fat intake (< 10% of energy intake).Concomitant interventions: 64 % meformin; 21% insulin; 64% lipid\u00e2\u0080\u0090lowering medication; 43% antihypertensive medication\t \tOutcomes\tChange in body weight (kg) at 3 to < 12 months: YesChange in body weight (kg) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoNumber of participants with 5% weight loss from baseline at 3 to < 12 months: YesNumber of participants with 5% weight loss from baseline at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoChange in BMI (kg/m2) at 3 to 12 months: YesChange in BMI (kg/m2) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoNumber of participants with 5% BMI reduction from baseline at 3 to 12 months: NoNumber of participants with 5% BMI reduction from baseline at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoChange in DBP (mmHg) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoChange in SBP (mmHg) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoAll\u00e2\u0080\u0090cause mortality at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoCardiovascular mortality at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoNon\u00e2\u0080\u0090fatal myocardial infarction at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoNon\u00e2\u0080\u0090fatal stroke at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoDiagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoChange in HbA1c (%) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoChange in LDL (mmol/L) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoChange in HDL (mmol/L) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoChange in non\u00e2\u0080\u0090HDL (mmom/L) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoChange in total cholesterol (TC) (mmol/L) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoChange in triglycerides (or triacylglycerides) (TG) (mmol/L) at \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: NoParticipant\u00e2\u0080\u0090reported adverse effects: Yes\t \tNotes\tNumber and type of records(s): journal articleTrial acronym/name: NoneTrial funded by: Pork Co\u00e2\u0080\u0090operative Research Centre (Pork CRC) grant, an initiative of the Australian governmentDeclaration of interest: \"This study was funded by a grant from the Pork Co\u00e2\u0080\u0090operative Research Centre (Pork CRC), an Australian Government funding initiative.

    "INTRO": "Background Description of the condition The 2017 Global Nutrition Report estimates that two billion adults worldwide are overweight or obese, and 41 million children are overweight (Development Initiatives 2017). For the first time in history, more people globally are dying from the consequences of overeating than starvation and malnutrition (Forouzanfar 2015). This shift has happened in the last 20 to 30 years and is thought to be mainly due to diets that are of poor nutritional quality, high in energy density and often ultra\u00e2\u0080\u0090processed. Such diets often result in cumulative weight gain over time and consequently increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, stroke and some cancers (Forouzanfar 2015). Globalised food systems promote over\u00e2\u0080\u0090consumption of these foods (Moubarac 2014;\u00c2\u00a0Swinburn 2011). High body mass index (BMI) is an important modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, kidney diseases, certain cancers and musculoskeletal conditions (Berrington 2010;\u00c2\u00a0ERFC 2011;\u00c2\u00a0GBMRF for CD Collaboration 2014;\u00c2\u00a0Singh 2013;\u00c2\u00a0Whitlock 2009;\u00c2\u00a0Zheng 2011). The disease burdens related to obesity are particularly evident in low\u00e2\u0080\u0090 and middle\u00e2\u0080\u0090income countries. Cardiovascular disease deaths rose by 12.5% from 15.9 million in 2005 to 17.9 million in 2015, and low\u00e2\u0080\u0090 and middle\u00e2\u0080\u0090income countries accounted for over three\u00e2\u0080\u0090quarters of these deaths (GBD MCDC 2016). In Africa, between 1980 and 2014, age\u00e2\u0080\u0090standardised prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) increased from 4.8% to 9.7% in men and from 7.7% to 12.6% in women (NCD\u00e2\u0080\u0090RisC 2017). These shifting disease patterns have a major impact on individual and family well\u00e2\u0080\u0090being, and on economies, with large direct and indirect costs being associated with illness. Description of the intervention Pharmacotherapy, bariatric surgery and counselling that target diet, physical activity, and behaviour change are used to treat adult obesity (Dietz 2015). Due to the chronic and relapsing nature of obesity and its related conditions, current guidelines for the treatment of obesity recommend comprehensive management approaches that aim to achieve long\u00e2\u0080\u0090term weight reduction. This includes intensive lifestyle intervention characterised by dietary restriction, increased physical activity, and behavioural management as first\u00e2\u0080\u0090line treatment (Dietz 2015;\u00c2\u00a0Jensen 2014). Importantly, there is no 'one\u00e2\u0080\u0090size\u00e2\u0080\u0090fits\u00e2\u0080\u0090all' weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diet and different diets work for different people, based on preferences and ease of adherence (Jensen 2014;\u00c2\u00a0Johnston 2014). The public, families and health professionals face an often dizzying array of weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets, many of which have been commercialised as books, seminars, diet food products, supplements and other related products. These include, but are not limited to, various versions of low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets (for example, Atkins diet (Atkins 1999)), low\u00e2\u0080\u0090fat or so\u00e2\u0080\u0090called 'balanced diets', very low\u00e2\u0080\u0090fat diets (for example, Ornish diet (Ornish 2001)), and low\u00e2\u0080\u0090glycaemic diets (for example, South Beach diet (Agatston 2003)). Nutrients are needed by the body in small (i.e. micronutrients such as vitamins and minerals) or large amounts (i.e. macronutrients) for growth, repair and optimal functioning (Lichtenstein 2005). Total daily energy intake is made up of the sum of the energy provided by the three macronutrients (i.e. carbohydrate, protein and fat). Per gram of macronutrient, carbohydrates and protein each provides about 17 kilojoules (approximately 4 kilocalories), while fat provides about 37 kilojoules (approximately 9 kilocalories) (Carreiro 2016). Carbohydrates are primarily contained in grains, cereals and sugar, and in the digestive tract are broken down into glucose. Carbohydrates are the largest nutrient class, and traditionally, the greatest energy source. If energy intake exceeds energy requirements, excess carbohydrates will be mainly stored in the liver as glycogen for later use or be converted to fatty acids when glycogen stores are saturated. In contrast, if the diet contains limited amounts of carbohydrate, the liver converts fat into fatty acids and ketones to replace glucose as an energy source (Paoli 2013). Low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets are a broad category of weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets and programmes that manipulate and restrict macronutrient (carbohydrate, protein, fat) intake (Astrup 2004;\u00c2\u00a0Bazzano 2012;\u00c2\u00a0Campbell 2012;\u00c2\u00a0Hession 2009). There are no consistent and widely accepted definitions of these diets and different descriptions are used, such as 'low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate, high\u00e2\u0080\u0090protein' or 'low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate, high\u00e2\u0080\u0090fat', depending on the macronutrient manipulation and focus. In practice, low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets are applied in different ways, but generally restrict grains, cereals and legumes, and other foods that contain carbohydrates, such as dairy, most fruit and certain vegetables. The energy required is then typically replaced with food higher in fat and protein, such as meats, eggs, cheese, butter, cream and oils \u00e2\u0080\u0090 many of which are animal source foods. Some low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets recommend eating as desired, while others apply restrictions to total energy intake (Atkins 2011;\u00c2\u00a0Campbell 2012). Conventional authorities such as the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA 2017), American Institute of Medicine Food and Nutrition Board (IOM 2005), Australian National Health and Medical Research Council together with the New Zealand Ministry of Health (NHMRC 2006), and the Nordic Council of Ministers, Nordic Committee of Senior Officials for Food Issues (NNR 2012), as well as the UK's Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN 2015), have recommended 45% to 65% of total energy as the appropriate carbohydrate intake for adults. Thus, some people regard low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets to be those with carbohydrate intakes below 45% of total energy. Some published definitions of low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets disregard the official recommendations, and use an upper limit of 40% of total energy from carbohydrates as indicative of a low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diet (Frigolet 2011;\u00c2\u00a0Wylie\u00e2\u0080\u0090Rosett 2013). In absolute, rather than proportional terms, low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets have been defined as having less than 200 g of carbohydrate (Frigolet 2011), while some disagree with this liberal definition, preferring to distinguish between 'non\u00e2\u0080\u0090ketogenic low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets' as containing 50 g to 150 g of carbohydrates, and 'ketogenic low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets' (or very low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets) as having a maximum of 50 g of carbohydrates, with this latter variant seen by some as being more effective for weight loss (Westman 2007;\u00c2\u00a0Yancy 2004). Ketogenic diets are characterised by a high production of ketones in the liver as an alternative energy source, as well as high levels of ketones in the blood (ketonaemia) and urine (ketonuria) when fat or protein intake is very high and carbohydrate intake is very low (less than 50 g/day) (Paoli 2013). Weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets aligned with current dietary recommendations are often referred to as 'low\u00e2\u0080\u0090fat diets' or 'balanced, weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets', and will be referred to as 'balanced diets' in this review (British Dietetic Association 2013). Globally, current dietary recommendations \u00e2\u0080\u0090 in terms of macronutrients, micronutrients, food choices and dietary patterns \u00e2\u0080\u0090 are generally consistent, and governmental bodies from Europe, the USA, Australia and Nordic countries recommend that 45% to 65% of total energy intake should be provided by carbohydrates, between 10% and 35% by protein and between 20% and 35% by fat (EFSA 2017;\u00c2\u00a0IOM 2005;\u00c2\u00a0NHMRC 2006;\u00c2\u00a0NNR 2012). There is room for flexibility within these ranges from lower to higher intakes of carbohydrate, fat and protein. These dietary recommendations are accompanied by information on 'better food' choices; improving the quality of carbohydrates (e.g. whole grains versus refined grains), protein (e.g. fish versus processed meat) and fat (e.g. olive oil versus butter); as well as on maintaining a healthy body weight by aiming to keep energy intake and energy expenditure balanced. Nutrition recommendations are moving away from macronutrient\u00e2\u0080\u0090focused, single food and single nutrient messages towards recommendations about dietary patterns and \u00e2\u0080\u0098total diets\u00e2\u0080\u0099 (NICE 2014;\u00c2\u00a0NNR 2012;\u00c2\u00a0USDA 2014). This has been driven mainly by the lack of clear and consistent associations between individual nutrients (micronutrients and macronutrients) and disease risk, limitations of single nutrient trials, and greater successes of 'total diet' or dietary pattern interventions. Dietary patterns can be defined as \"the quantities, proportions, variety, or combination of different foods, drinks, and nutrients (when available) in diets, and the frequency with which they are habitually consumed\" (USDA 2014). Current evidence supports associations between some dietary patterns and lower risk of obesity and chronic diseases, especially T2DM, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and certain cancers (DGAC 2015;\u00c2\u00a0USDA 2014). For example, systematic reviews of large long\u00e2\u0080\u0090term studies show that several dietary patterns are consistently and equally associated with a lower risk of developing T2DM\u00c2\u00a0in the future (Alhazmi 2014;\u00c2\u00a0Esposito 2014;\u00c2\u00a0Koloverou 2014). These dietary patterns have different macronutrient compositions, but share several common components, including fruit, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, healthy oils, adequate proteins (such as seafood and lean meat), reduced intake of red and processed meats and sugar\u00e2\u0080\u0090sweetened beverages, and little or moderate alcohol (Ndanuko 2016;\u00c2\u00a0NNR 2012;\u00c2\u00a0USDA 2014). It has been suggested that carbohydrate avoidance and the resultant food restrictions typical of low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets make it difficult to achieve a dietary pattern that is nutrient\u00e2\u0080\u0090 and fibre\u00e2\u0080\u0090rich, diverse, and that promotes good health (USDA 2014). How the intervention might work Energy balance and body\u00e2\u0080\u0090weight regulation is complex and interactive, and questions on certain components of energy balance and their interactions \u00e2\u0080\u0090 especially over the longer term \u00e2\u0080\u0090 are yet to be answered (Hall 2012). The first law of thermodynamics and evidence from various types of studies over the past 50 years, including randomised controlled trials (RCTs), support the view that weight loss occurs when the amount of kilojoules consumed during eating and drinking is less than the amount of kilojoules expended over weeks or months (ACC/AHA 2013 Full Report;\u00c2\u00a0Hall 2011;\u00c2\u00a0Hall 2012;\u00c2\u00a0Hall 2015;\u00c2\u00a0Jensen 2014). Thus, a plausible mechanism whereby low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets enable weight loss is by achieving a sustained energy deficit over time even when advice to explicitly restrict energy intake is not provided. When people eliminate and restrict carbohydrate\u00e2\u0080\u0090rich foods, they are more likely to reduce energy intake because they eat less food (Brehm 2003;\u00c2\u00a0Sondike 2003). Related mechanisms reported in the literature include a reduction in appetite with low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets, possibly related to the increased intake of fat and production of ketones (Boden 2005;\u00c2\u00a0Nordmann 2006;\u00c2\u00a0Westman 2007). Since total energy intake is known to drive changes in body weight, its role must be considered when examining the effect on any diet on weight changes. Some literature indicates that certain macronutrients may have metabolic advantages over others, more specifically that lower carbohydrate intake is more effective for weight loss, independent of energy intake (Atkins 2011;\u00c2\u00a0Westman 2007). However, it has been proposed that when proportions of macronutrients in the diet are changed, rapid physiological adaptations occur that aim to match metabolic fuel selection to the diet. Changes in body composition and energy expenditure may be minimised by these adaptations. In this scenario, in the shorter term, all reduced energy diets would have a similar effect on loss of body fat (Hall 2011;\u00c2\u00a0Noakes 2006;\u00c2\u00a0Tay 2008). Literature on low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets also suggest that the reduced insulin secretion resulting from a low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diet causes greater release of adipose tissue free fatty acids, fat oxidation and energy expenditure, and increased loss of body fat compared to restricting fat intake (Ludwig 2014;\u00c2\u00a0Taubes 2007;\u00c2\u00a0Westman 2007). However, a study in 19 obese adults confined to a metabolic ward demonstrated that an equal kilojoule\u00e2\u0080\u0090selective reduction in dietary fat resulted in no changes in insulin secretion, fat oxidation or energy expenditure and a greater net fat loss when compared to restricting carbohydrates by the same amount, which resulted in decreased insulin secretion, increased fat oxidation and decreased energy expenditure (Hall 2015). According to recent clinical guidelines for obesity, a high\u00e2\u0080\u0090quality systematic review, a scientific report to inform dietary guidelines and a recent six\u00e2\u0080\u0090month randomised controlled feeding trial, a number of different diets may lead to weight loss over the short term if they achieve a sustained energy deficit, but some of these diets may be more advantageous than others for maintaining longer\u00e2\u0080\u0090term cardiovascular and metabolic health (DGAC 2015;\u00c2\u00a0Jensen 2014;\u00c2\u00a0Johnston 2014;\u00c2\u00a0Wan 2017). There is evidence that weight loss of 5% and more, or BMI reduction of at least 5%, may result in clinically meaningful improvements in cardio metabolic health following dietary regimens (Brown 2016;\u00c2\u00a0Truby 2006;\u00c2\u00a0Wald 2012;\u00c2\u00a0Wing 2010). Adherence and weight maintenance Poor dietary adherence has been regarded as one of the reasons popular and traditional dieting strategies are unsuccessful, and it is well known that adherence to nutrition counselling by study participants varies widely. Evidence from quality RCTs, systematic reviews and other study designs suggest that adherence to diets is a primary driver of weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090loss success, regardless of the macronutrient composition, and may explain a considerable part of whether dieters are able to achieve energy deficit for weight loss (Alhassan 2008;\u00c2\u00a0Dansinger 2005;\u00c2\u00a0Hall 2011;\u00c2\u00a0Johnston 2014;\u00c2\u00a0Sacks 2009). Dietary intake is difficult to measure accurately, and fidelity of application of dietary assessment methods varies widely across studies (Shim 2014), which may introduce a lot of variation into the assessment of adherence. Consequently, data on adherence to assigned diets are often lacking in weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090loss trials. Also, keeping the weight off once lost is also a considerable challenge in treating obesity, with most people tending to relapse (Dietz 2015). Indeed, a systematic review including 56 RCTs reported that dieting to lose weight is most often over weeks, months or years, and it is challenging for most people to maintain the weight lost over the long term (Collins 2013). Thus, ease of adherence to weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets is a key factor to consider. It is also necessary to consider the time\u00e2\u0080\u0090dependant nature of the relationship between diet and weight change when examining the effect of diets on weight change. Trials typically have different periods of follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up, and different frequencies or intervals of study contacts and measurement.\u00c2\u00a0Tay 2015\u00c2\u00a0indicated that changes sustained over a 12\u00e2\u0080\u0090month period reflects durability of effects over the long term. Why it is important to do this review The public spends considerable amounts of money and time on trying to diet, on books about diet, and on products and foods to enhance weight loss. It is therefore important to examine scientific evidence behind the claims made. Some advocates claim low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets decrease cardiovascular disease and diabetes risk profiles: reducing triglycerides, increasing high\u00e2\u0080\u0090density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and improving glycaemic control over one year (Stern 2004); improving triglycerides, HDL cholesterol and glycaemic control over four years (Wing 2010); and improving aortic stiffness over four weeks (Syed\u00e2\u0080\u0090Abdul 2018). However, the diets are not without potential side effects. These include gastrointestinal disturbances, such as constipation, flatulence, indigestion or diarrhoea over the short term (Bhardwaj 2017;\u00c2\u00a0Brinkworth 2009a;\u00c2\u00a0Saslow 2014); and increasing low\u00e2\u0080\u0090density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and non\u00e2\u0080\u0090HDL cholesterol over 12 months (Brinkworth 2009b;\u00c2\u00a0Wan 2017). Some participants report mood disturbance and impaired ability to concentrate (Brinkworth 2009c;\u00c2\u00a0Halyburton 2007). Other side effects of low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets include lack of appetite, bad breath, headaches, muscle cramps, general weakness and hair loss (Foster 2010;\u00c2\u00a0Rio 2001;\u00c2\u00a0Yancy 2004). A prospective cohort study and meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis that combined 25\u00e2\u0080\u0090year follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Community (ARIC) data (USA) and seven other cohort studies (USA, Europe, Asia and multinational) assessed the association between carbohydrate intake and mortality (Seidelmann 2018). Findings indicated that both high\u00e2\u0080\u0090 and low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets increased mortality, with the lowest risk observed among those who consumed a diet containing 50% to 55% carbohydrates. The low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate dietary patterns that favoured animal fat and protein sources were associated with higher mortality, while those that favoured plant\u00e2\u0080\u0090based foods were associated with lower mortality. Additionally, diets very high in animal source foods could pose a significant threat to environmental sustainability (Sabate 2014;\u00c2\u00a0Soret 2014). The debate on effective and safe diets for treating obesity continues. Many trials and systematic reviews involving obese people (with and without comorbidities), of varying methodological quality, have assessed the effects of low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets on weight and other risk factors. \u00c2\u00a0A number of these studies show little or no clinically important difference in weight loss of up to two years' follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up (Chawla 2020;\u00c2\u00a0Dong 2020;\u00c2\u00a0Van Zuuren 2018). A systematic review of eight RCTs found that improvements in psychosocial outcomes occur in participants on short\u00e2\u0080\u0090 and longer\u00e2\u0080\u0090term weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090loss programmes, regardless of the macronutrient composition of the diet (Ghoch 2016). However, low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets continue to be widely promoted, marketed and commercialised as being more effective for weight loss, and healthier, than weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets that have 'balanced' or macronutrient compositions in line with current global dietary recommendations. Healthcare officials argue that very restrictive carbohydrate diets do not promote behaviour changes that foster varied, nutrient\u00e2\u0080\u0090 and fibre\u00e2\u0080\u0090rich dietary patterns (USDA 2014), known to reduce risks of cardiovascular disease, hypertension, T2DM\u00c2\u00a0and certain cancers. Extreme restriction or excess of macronutrients, as advised with very low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets, instead promote a way of eating that is likely to result in an imbalance of macronutrient intake, suboptimal micronutrient intake and increased disease risk over time. Previously, we took stock of existing systematic reviews on low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets for adults wanting to lose weight. We found 50 existing reviews (last search date: 3 March 2014), with a number of shortcomings as reported in\u00c2\u00a0Naude 2014. This exercise helped inform the protocol for our earlier systematic review and meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis of RCTs (Naude 2014). This Cochrane Review will be a fresh edition to\u00c2\u00a0Naude 2014, by taking into account new eligible trials, and comments and criticisms generated by the earlier work. Objectives To compare the effects of low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets to weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets with balanced ranges of carbohydrates, in relation to changes in weight and cardiovascular risk, in overweight and obese adults without T2DM\u00c2\u00a0(comparisons 1 and 2) and with T2DM\u00c2\u00a0(comparisons 3 and 4)",
    "METHODS": "Methods Criteria for considering studies for this review Types of studies As per our protocol (Naude 2019), we included parallel\u00e2\u0080\u0090arm individual\u00e2\u0080\u0090 and cluster\u00e2\u0080\u0090randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that had an active weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing intervention phase of at least 12 weeks. According to\u00c2\u00a0Jensen 2014, obese individuals on a moderately restricted energy intake can potentially lose between six and eight kilograms, or five to ten per cent of initial body weight (clinically meaningful) over a six\u00e2\u0080\u0090month period. From this, we inferred that it would be plausible to lose five per cent of initial weight over a three\u00e2\u0080\u0090month period. According to the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), 12 weeks is the standard length for most commissioned dietary interventions (Ahern 2017;\u00c2\u00a0NICE 2014). Follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up of participants after the intervention ended could be of any duration. We excluded quasi\u00e2\u0080\u0090randomised trials (that is, trials that used an inadequate method of randomisation, such as alternation or date of birth). We included cross\u00e2\u0080\u0090over trials where the first phase was 12 weeks or longer, and where data for the first phase per group were available. We excluded cross\u00e2\u0080\u0090over trials not meeting these criteria due to the possible period and carry\u00e2\u0080\u0090over effects that would arise with the eligible dietary interventions, condition (overweight and obesity) and outcomes in this review, with these not being easily reversible as required for a valid cross\u00e2\u0080\u0090over design (Younge 2015). We only included studies with a weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phase if the preceding weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phase was for 12 weeks or longer, and relevant data from this phase were available. We separated analyses for weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing and weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phases. Types of participants We included adults (18 years and older) who were overweight or living with obesity (as defined by trial authors), with or without T2DM, and with or without cardiovascular conditions or risk factors such as hypertension or dyslipidaemia (as defined by trial authors). We excluded studies where pregnant and lactating women were included, as well as studies in people with specific medical conditions such as bipolar disorder, polycystic ovary syndrome, chronic renal disease, and so on. We included studies involving a subset of eligible participants (for example, adults and children, as defined by trial authors) if results were reported separately for the eligible subset (for example, those \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 18 years). If not, we only included such studies if 80% or more of the baseline sample were eligible for our review (for example, aged \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 18 years). We excluded data from such studies in sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of the primary meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analyses. Types of interventions Treatment diet We included RCTs investigating low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets where the diets were explicitly implemented for the primary purpose of reducing weight, with or without explicit advice to restrict total energy intake. Control diet We included RCTs where the control diets had a carbohydrate content within the balanced range of 45% to 65% of total energy, and where the diets were explicitly implemented for the primary purpose of reducing weight, with or without advice to restrict total energy intake. We included studies where diets were implemented by provision of advice, food or both. However, we excluded studies with the following. Treatment diet had carbohydrate content 45% or more of total energy or more than 150 g per day. Treatment and control diets were different in some other respect that may influence the predefined outcomes, except for total energy intake. Treatment or control diets were not adequately defined (and could not be obtained from study authors) or where the control diet was \u00e2\u0080\u0098no dietary intervention'. Diets were combined with any other co\u00e2\u0080\u0090interventions (e.g. exercise, pharmacological, surgical) where these differed by group. Dietary interventions had an exclusive focus on energy restriction (i.e. no macronutrient manipulation was explicitly instituted). Interventions focused solely on specific foods (e.g. oats), food groups (e.g. dairy) or food components (e.g. plant sterols), or where meal replacements or supplements were part of the diets and were different in the diets being compared. Participants were selected based on a possible prognostic variable (for example, genotype). Types of outcome measures We did not exclude studies on the basis of outcomes measured. However, we did exclude studies measuring only immediate meal responses (e.g. postprandial changes in blood sugar) and not longer\u00e2\u0080\u0090term physiological responses to diet. Primary outcomes Change in body weight (kg) from baseline Number of participants per group with weight loss of at least 5% from baseline We assessed the primary outcomes at short\u00e2\u0080\u0090term (3 months to < 12 months) and long\u00e2\u0080\u0090term (\u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months) follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up. Secondary outcomes Clinical Change in body mass index (BMI; kg/m2) from baseline Number of participants per group with reduction in BMI of at least 5% from baseline We assessed the above clinical outcomes at short\u00e2\u0080\u0090term (three months to < 12 months) and long\u00e2\u0080\u0090term (\u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months) follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up. Change in diastolic blood pressure (mmHg) Change in systolic blood pressure (mmHg) All\u00e2\u0080\u0090cause mortality Cardiovascular mortality Non\u00e2\u0080\u0090fatal myocardial infarction Non\u00e2\u0080\u0090fatal stroke Diagnosis of T2DM\u00c2\u00a0(as reported by study authors) We assessed these clinical outcomes at long\u00e2\u0080\u0090term (\u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months) follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up only. Laboratory Change in glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) (%) Change in serum low\u00e2\u0080\u0090density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (mmol/L) Change in serum high\u00e2\u0080\u0090density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (mmol/L) Change in serum non\u00e2\u0080\u0090HDL cholesterol (mmol/L) Change in serum total cholesterol (mmol/L) Change in serum triglycerides (mmol/L) We assessed these laboratory outcomes at long\u00e2\u0080\u0090term (\u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months) follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up only. Participant\u00e2\u0080\u0090reported adverse effects Participant\u00e2\u0080\u0090reported adverse effects, specifically in regard to lack of appetite, bad breath, weakness, headaches, gastrointestinal problems (constipation, diarrhoea, flatulence, indigestion) and psychosocial problems (mood disturbances) at any time point, limited to those described in included studies. We regarded constipation as a patient\u00e2\u0080\u0090important outcome since it is frequently reported by people following low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets. Search methods for identification of studies We used a comprehensive search strategy aiming to identify all eligible studies regardless of language or publication status. Electronic searches We identified RCTs through systematic searches of the following bibliographic databases: MEDLINE (PubMed, from 1946 to 25 June 2021) Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2021, Issue 6), in the Cochrane Library Embase (Ovid, from 1947 to 28 June 2021) Web of Science Core Collection with Indexes SCI\u00e2\u0080\u0090Expanded, SSCi, CPCI\u00e2\u0080\u0090S (Clarivate Analytics, from 1970 to 25 June 2021) We also on 25 June 2021 searched ClinicalTrials.gov () and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP)\u00c2\u00a0for ongoing and unpublished trials (). We first designed the search strategy for MEDLINE (PubMed) and then adapted it for use in the other sources (Appendix 1).\u00c2 We did not do a separate search for adverse effects of interventions; we only considered adverse effects reported in included studies. Searching other resources We checked reference lists of all included studies and relevant systematic reviews identified for additional references to trials. We set out to examine any relevant retraction statements and errata for included studies; however, we did not come across any. Data collection and analysis Selection of studies \u00c2\u00a0We imported all de\u00e2\u0080\u0090duplicated search records into\u00c2\u00a0Covidence. Two review authors independently screened the titles and abstracts of these records to identify all potential eligible studies. Discrepancies in first\u00e2\u0080\u0090line screening choices were resolved by discussion among at least two review authors. We retrieved the full\u00e2\u0080\u0090text report for each record that the screeners considered potentially eligible, and two review authors (CN, KN, AS, AB) independently screened all full texts, identifying studies for inclusion, and identifying and recording reasons for exclusion of the ineligible studies. We resolved any disagreement through discussion or, if required, consultation with a third review author (TY, JV). We identified and excluded duplicates and collated multiple reports of the same study so that each study, rather than each report, was the unit of interest in the review. We recorded the selection process in sufficient detail to complete a PRISMA flow diagram (Moher 2009), and 'Characteristics of excluded studies' table. Studies where full reports (published or unpublished) were not available (e.g. conference abstracts), or where there was unclear or missing information (that could not be obtained from study authors) such that we could not ascertain study eligibility, were placed, with a reason, in the 'Characteristics of studies awaiting classification' table. Data extraction and management To extract study characteristics and outcome data, we created a data collection form in DistillerSR (DistillerSR), and piloted it on two included studies. Data from each included study were extracted independently by two review authors (AB, KN, AS, CN). We contacted the study authors when reported information was unclear or contradictory, or when important data were missing. It was not necessary to seek translations. We extracted the following: Methods: authors' contact details, type of record (e.g. journal article, thesis), study design, study population, study dates, total duration of the intervention and follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up duration after the intervention where relevant, details of 'run\u00e2\u0080\u0090in' periods where relevant, number of study centres and location, study setting, method of recruitment, number of study arms, description of eligible study arms, outcome used for sample size calculation, unit of allocation, number randomised per study arm (for individually\u00e2\u0080\u0090randomised trials), number of clusters and number of participants per cluster who consented (for cluster\u00e2\u0080\u0090randomised trials), number of withdrawals and those lost to follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up, number completed and analysed, other relevant notes on the methods. Participants: inclusion and exclusion criteria, age, gender (number of male and female participants per group), baseline body weight status, other baseline cardiovascular disease risk factors and potential confounders, any group differences. Interventions: treatment diet, control diet, implementation or delivery of diets, dietary intake assessments (e.g. what, how frequent, by whom), concomitant interventions. Outcomes: primary and secondary outcomes specified and collected at relevant time points, data on adherence to the interventions, and whether primary study authors analysed results separately according to gender. Notes: study funding, conflicts of interest declarations of study authors, and other relevant notes. For outcomes, we extracted change data (i.e. change from baseline to outcome assessment per group) where possible, with relevant data on variance for treatment and control arms and numbers of participants per arm at that time point. Where change data were not available, we extracted and used data at study end (i.e. end values), or other relevant time points, along with variance and number of participants per arm at that time point.\u00c2 Where possible, we converted variables to comparable units to allow pooling of data, if appropriate.\u00c2\u00a0Calleja\u00e2\u0080\u0090Fern\u00c3\u00a1ndez 2012\u00c2\u00a0stratified by homeostatic model assessment (insulin resistant (IR) and insulin sensitive (IS)) before randomisation. We combined IR and IS group data using Cochrane methods to combine subgroups (Higgins 2021).\u00c2\u00a0Saslow 2017a\u00c2\u00a0reported appetite change as hunger change scores using means and Cohen's d values for each diet group. We converted Cohen's d values to standard deviations (SD) using the formula SD = mean/Cohen's d.\u00c2 We stratified included trials into those in participants without T2DM (comparisons 1 and 2)\u00c2\u00a0and those in participants with T2DM (comparisons 3 and 4).\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2 We resolved disagreements by consensus or by involving a third review author (MC, TY, JV). We exported data from DistillerSR and imported it into the latest version of Review Manager Web (RevMan Web 2020) via Microsoft Excel. We completed the 'Characteristics of included studies' table for all included studies. We used key items from the TIDieR checklist (Hoffman 2014) to aid description, interpretation and discussion of the results. Brief details of ongoing studies are reported in the 'Characteristics of ongoing studies' table, and these studies will be considered for inclusion in a future update of the review. Assessment of risk of bias in included studies Three reviewers (CN, AB and AS) assessed risk of bias for each study using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool (RoB2) for randomised controlled trials (Sterne 2019). This tool was used to assess the effect of the assignment to the intervention, for the following domains: bias arising from the randomisation process; bias due to deviations from intended interventions; bias due to missing outcome data; bias in measurement of the outcome; bias in selection of the reported result. We did not have to carry out the planned assessments of risk of bias for cross\u00e2\u0080\u0090over and cluster\u00e2\u0080\u0090randomised controlled trials, as none of the eligible trials had these designs.\u00c2 We judged each domain as either 'low risk of bias', 'some concerns' or 'high risk of bias' for the following outcomes reported in the summary of findings tables: change in body weight (kg) measured from baseline to between three and < 12 months; change in body weight (kg) measured from baseline to \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months; number of participants per group with weight loss of at least 5% measured from baseline to \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months; cardiovascular mortality measured from baseline to \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months; change in diastolic blood pressure (mmHg) measured from baseline to \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months; change in HbA1c (%) (for\u00c2\u00a0comparisons in participants with T2DM) measured from baseline to \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months; change in serum LDL cholesterol (mmol/L) measured from baseline to \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months; participant\u00e2\u0080\u0090reported constipation at any time point from baseline to three and < 12 months. Overall, per included study, we made judgements according to the following criteria: low risk of bias: when all domains were at low risk; some concerns: when one or more domains had some concerns, but none were at a high risk of bias; high risk of bias: when one or more domains were at high risk of bias, or multiple domains had some concerns to the extent that these reduced confidence in the results. We resolved any disagreements by discussion or by involving another review author(MC or AS). Measures of treatment effect For dichotomous data, we used the number of events as the numerator and the total sample size per outcome as the denominator in each relevant comparison group and computed the risk ratio (RR) (available case data). For continuous data, we reported results per outcome as the difference in the mean change (and, if not available, the difference in end values) between the treatment and control groups, and computed the mean difference (MD) (available case data). We entered data presented as a scale with a consistent direction of effect. We used Review Manager Web to conduct meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analyses for each outcome, where appropriate, to determine a pooled effect of low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets compared to balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets. We narratively described skewed data reported as medians and interquartile ranges. Unit of analysis issues In the case of multiple intervention groups, we selected one pair of interventions (treatment and control) most relevant to this systematic review question. We did not need to apply the planned approach for unit of analysis issues related to clustering as no cluster\u00e2\u0080\u0090randomised trials were eligible. Where a study reported outcome data for more than one time point within our time point categories (3 months to < 12 months; and \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months), we used the longest time point (for example, where results were available at three months and five months, we only used the five\u00e2\u0080\u0090month data). Dealing with missing data We contacted study authors or sponsors to clarify key study characteristics and obtain missing numerical outcome data, where needed. Where study authors had not reported all relevant statistics per outcome (for example, sample size, mean change and standard deviation of change per group), we calculated or estimated the required data from other reported statistics using formulas specified in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011), if possible. Where we could not calculate or estimate these statistics with reasonable confidence, we contacted the study authors by email. When we did not receive a response, we did not impute the missing values, but reported the available results narratively or in a table, as appropriate. For interventions in which there was substantial attrition (15% or more for at least one of the groups) of study participants, we reported the attrition rate. We also performed sensitivity analyses excluding studies with some concerns or a high risk of bias for the missing outcome data domain in RoB 2. Assessment of heterogeneity We examined heterogeneity per outcome firstly by visual inspection of the forest plots (i.e. we looked at physical overlap of confidence intervals across the included studies). Secondly, we assessed statistical heterogeneity among the intervention effects across the included studies in each meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analysis as follows: Chi2 test for heterogeneity I2 statistic to quantify heterogeneity Tau2 statistic to measure the extent of heterogeneity In our meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analyses, we considered substantial heterogeneity as an I2 statistic value of greater than 50% and either a Chi2 test of less than 0.1 or Tau2 statistic greater than 0. In meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analyses with substantial heterogeneity, we performed prespecified subgroup analyses on the outcomes in the summary of findings tables. Where we identified unexplained substantial heterogeneity, we did not pool results into an overall effect estimate but rather presented the individual effect sizes per study for the specific outcome.\u00c2 Assessment of reporting biases Where data per comparison and outcome allowed us to pool more than 10 studies, we explored the possibility of small study biases for the primary outcomes using funnel plots. In the case of asymmetry, we considered various explanations such as publication bias, poor study design and the effect of study size. Data synthesis We used a random\u00e2\u0080\u0090effects model for meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analyses since we anticipated heterogeneity between included studies due to variations in the composition of weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090loss diets, adherence to diets, intervention duration and dietary assessment methodology. For dichotomous outcomes, we used the Mantel\u00e2\u0080\u0090Haenszel method, unless the number of events were not available but estimates of effect measure and their standard errors were, in which case we used the inverse variance method. For continuous outcomes, we used the inverse variance method. We analysed trials in overweight and obese participants without T2DM\u00c2\u00a0following diets with a weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phase only (comparison 1), or a weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phase followed by a weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phase (comparison 2); as well as overweight and obese participants with T2DM\u00c2\u00a0following diets with a weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phase only (comparison 3), or a weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phase followed by a weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phase (comparison 4). These analyses were done separately, where possible, as the presence of diabetes is likely to influence the effects of the diets. When not explicitly stated, we regarded weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phases as periods where initial diet prescriptions or advice changed to indicate less focus on active weight reduction, for example, changes in energy prescriptions or no restrictions on carbohydrate intake.\u00c2 We analysed outcome data at the time point \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months, because it captures sustainability of effects on weight loss, clinical, as well as laboratory outcomes. However, for the weight and BMI outcomes, we also analysed data at the time point three months to < 12 months, as many people going on weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090loss diets are especially interested to know how fast they would be losing weight, and experienced weight loss over the short term also serves as motivation to keep going longer term. We preferentially extracted and used data from the intention\u00e2\u0080\u0090to\u00e2\u0080\u0090treat (ITT) analyses of trials (as reported by trial authors) in all our meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analyses. By ITT, we mean that randomised participants were analysed according to the group to which they were randomised; however, if there were missing data we did not perform any imputations. Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity Where data allowed, we carried out the following subgroup analyses for the outcomes in the summary of findings tables, to explore substantial heterogeneity and the stability of findings in different study subgroups, as follows. By extent of carbohydrate restriction (i.e. very low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate or ketogenic diets: carbohydrate prescription of \u00e2\u0089\u00a4 50 g per day or < 10% of total daily energy intake from a nominal 8400 kilojoule (approximately 2000 kilocalories) diet; and non\u00e2\u0080\u0090ketogenic low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets: > 50 g to 150 g per day or < 45% of total energy intake) By similarity of total energy prescription (i.e. studies with substantial differences in daily total energy prescription (> 500 kilojoules or approximately 120 kilocalories) in treatment and control groups, for example, ad libitum energy prescription in the treatment diet and restricted energy prescription in the control diet, studies with similar energy prescription or similar approach used to restrict energy intake in treatment and control groups, studies with no energy prescription reported or unrestricted energy intake prescribed in both treatment and control groups) By diagnosed cardiovascular event or disease (i.e. studies in people with no events or disease, studies in people with events or disease, and studies in people with and without events or disease) By gender Sensitivity analysis Where data allowed, we carried out sensitivity analyses for primary outcomes, assessing the effect of: overall low risk and 'some concerns' of bias (i.e. we first pooled all relevant studies per outcome, and then pooled only studies with overall low risk and 'some concerns' of bias); attrition bias (i.e. we first pooled all relevant studies per outcome, and then pooled only studies at low risk of bias for the missing outcome data domain); studies including only a subset of eligible participants for this review (i.e. we first pooled all relevant studies per outcome, and then pooled only studies that included only participants eligible for inclusion in this review);\u00c2 clustering (i.e. we first pooled all relevant studies per outcome, and then pooled only studies that randomised individual participants); and source of funding (i.e. we first pooled studies with all funding sources, and then pooled only studies without diet/food industry funding). Summary of findings and assessment of the certainty of the evidence Based on the methods described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011), we prepared four summary of findings tables, one for each comparison in participants without and with T2DM. In these tables, we included change in body weight (kg) measured from baseline to between three and < 12 months, and the following outcomes measured from baseline to \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 months: change in body weight (kg); number of participants per group with weight loss of at least 5%; cardiovascular mortality; change in diastolic blood pressure (mmHg); change in HbA1c (%) (for comparisons 3 and 4 in participants with T2DM); change in serum LDL cholesterol (mmol/L), as well as participant\u00e2\u0080\u0090reported constipation at 3 to < 12 months. We used the GRADE approach to rank the certainty of the evidence as it related to the studies that contributed data to the meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analyses for the prespecified outcomes, using GRADEpro GDT software (). The GRADE tool includes five considerations (study limitations, inconsistencies of results, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias) to assess the certainty of the evidence from RCTs. We justified all decisions to downgrade the quality of evidence using footnotes, and made comments to aid readers' understanding where necessary. Three review authors (CN, AS, AB) made judgements about evidence certainty, with disagreements resolved by discussion, and involving a third review author where needed. We extracted study data, formatted our comparisons in data tables and prepared a summary of findings table for each of the four comparisons\u00c2\u00a0before writing the results and conclusions of our review.",

    "DISCUSS": "Discussion Summary of main results This review examined the effects of low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets compared to 'balanced'\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets on weight and cardiovascular risk factors. We used approaches aimed at addressing factors that may limit interpretation in other similar reviews. These included explicit criteria for the compositions and intentions of the treatment and control diets, stratifying findings in participants without and with T2DM, separating findings from weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing and weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phases of diets, meaningful and comparable follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up periods, comprehensive searches, and multiple efforts to obtain and include all relevant and necessary data and information not reported in published papers; as well as assessing the certainty of this evidence using GRADE. To our knowledge, this review includes the largest number of trials that have examined this question to date. Low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets compared to balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets (weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phases only) Participants without and with T2DM in both low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate and balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diet groups reduced their weight to varying degrees in the short term (range of weight reduction across both diets: 12.2 to 0.33 kg) and long term (range of weight reduction across both diets: 13.1 to 1.7 kg). We considered a loss of at least 5% of initial weight to be clinically meaningful, and a weight change that could reasonably be expected in our minimum diet duration of 12 weeks. Thus, reductions from around the middle of these ranges (about 4 to 6 kg in most trials) would start to become clinically meaningful and translate to improvements in cardio metabolic health (Brown 2016;\u00c2\u00a0Franz 2015;\u00c2\u00a0Jensen 2014;\u00c2\u00a0Truby 2006;\u00c2\u00a0Wald 2012;\u00c2\u00a0Wing 2010).\u00c2 Notably, in overweight and obese participants without and with T2DM, the meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analyses showed little or no difference between the effects of low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets and balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets on weight reduction over three to 8.5 months (short term), with mean differences in weight reduction of about one kilogram. This was also the case over one to two years (long term), with mean differences in weight reduction of less than one kilogram. The 95% CIs of pooled mean differences in short\u00e2\u0080\u0090 and long\u00e2\u0080\u0090term weight change did not include appreciable harm or benefit (ranging from 2.44 kg lower to 1.46 kg higher), and we therefore did not downgrade for imprecision. The lack of differences found in effects on weight reduction were confirmed by sensitivity analyses. There was, however, some heterogeneity in effects in participants without T2DM over the short term. Subgrouping by similarity of energy prescription, extent of carbohydrate restriction, diagnosed cardiovascular event or disease at baseline or gender did not suggest important clinical differences in average effects between the various subgroups. Mean differences in weight reduction between diet groups across the various subgroups at the short term ranged between 0.25 kg and 2.71 kg. Some heterogeneity could be explained by subgrouping studies according to similarity of energy prescription and extent of carbohydrate restriction.\u00c2 We do not know whether there is a difference in the number of participants per group with weight loss of at least 5% at the long term since only one trial (n = 68) in men, judged as being at high risk of bias, reported on this outcome. For mean changes in DBP at one to two years, some trials reported reductions and other trials reported increases in both diet groups in participants without and with T2DM (range of mean change across diet groups: \u00e2\u0080\u009011 to 4.3 mmHg). In all participants, meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analyses showed little or no difference between the effects of the two diets on changes in DBP at one to two years, with mean differences of less than 0.5 mmHg. The 95% CIs of these pooled mean differences did not include appreciable harm or benefit (ranging from 1.84 mmHg lower to 1.28 mmHg higher) and we did not downgrade for imprecision. We considered changes in DBP of greater than 2 mmHg to be clinically meaningful (Whelton 2002). At one to two years in both diet groups, some trials reported reductions in LDL cholesterol and others reported increases in participants without and with T2DM (range of mean change across diet groups: \u00e2\u0080\u00900.61 to 0.6 mmol/L). Meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analyses showed little or no difference between the effects of the two diets on changes in LDL cholesterol at one to two years in all participants, with mean differences of up to 0.1 mmol/L. The 95% CIs of these pooled mean differences did not include appreciable harm or benefit (ranging from 0.05 mmol/L lower to 0.26 mmol/L higher) and we did not downgrade for imprecision. We considered changes in LDL cholesterol of greater than 0.26 mmol/L to be clinically meaningful (Fernandez\u00e2\u0080\u0090Friera\u00c2\u00a02017;\u00c2\u00a0Howard 2000). At one to two years, some trials in participants with T2DM reported reductions in HbA1c and others reported small increases in HbA1c in both diet groups (range of change across diet groups: \u00e2\u0080\u00902% to 0.2%). Pooling these mean differences found little or no difference between the effects of low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets versus balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets on change in HbA1c over one to two years in overweight and obese participants with T2DM, with a mean difference of 0.14%. The 95% CI of the pooled mean difference did not include appreciable harm or benefit (0.38% lower to 0.1% higher) and we did not downgrade for imprecision. We considered changes in HbA1c of greater than 0.5% to be clinically meaningful (NICE 2015). Participant\u00e2\u0080\u0090reported adverse effects were poorly reported. In the few trials where these were reported, the effects included constipation, which we regarded as a patient\u00e2\u0080\u0090important adverse effect since it is frequently reported by people following low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets. These limited data mean that we are very uncertain about whether there is a difference in the number of participants per diet group with constipation at three to six months in all participants. Low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets compared to balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets (weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phase followed by weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phase) Evidence about the comparative effects of diets from studies using weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phases followed by weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phases was limited. Only eight trials reported these data for some outcomes, and one of these trials did not contribute any numeric data to meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analyses. All the trials applied different approaches and time frames to the weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phases of the diets, with the shortest weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phase being six weeks and the longest being 21 months. Findings were similar to the comparisons that included only weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phases of the two diets, but our certainty in these findings was lower, largely due to imprecision, with small total sample sizes and wide 95% CIs around the pooled estimates.\u00c2 In overweight and obese participants without T2DM, meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analyses showed that low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets including a weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phase may result in little or no difference in change in weight over one to two years compared to balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets including a weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phase. We are very uncertain about whether there are differences in effects on DBP and LDL cholesterol between the two diets in these participants. None of the eight trials reported usable data for the other outcomes in our summary of findings table.\u00c2 In overweight and obese participants with T2DM, meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analyses showed that low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets including a weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phase may result in little or no difference in change in weight at six months, and at one to two years, compared to balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets including a weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phase. This was also the case for change in HbA1c and LDL cholesterol. We are very uncertain about whether there are differences in effects on DBP between the two diets in these participants. None of the eight trials reported usable data for the other outcomes in our summary of findings table. Overall completeness and applicability of evidence Our review employed a comprehensive search strategy with no language restrictions to identify all RCTs assessing the effects of low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets on weight and cardiovascular risk in overweight and obese adults without or with T2DM. We tapped multiple sources of information for all trials and contacted study authors multiple times in all cases where we needed additional data or information. This included requesting information from 30 author teams to enable clear judgements and reporting related to eligibility, stratification, risk of bias, as well as numeric data to enable the inclusion of as much usable data in meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analyses as we could obtain.\u00c2 We prespecified outcomes at defined lengths of follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up to examine possible differences in effects over time. No trials reported on outcomes after two years, and 60% of trials had a duration of six months or less. Change in body weight was reported by most trials, but few studies trials reported on the number of participants per group with weight loss of at least 5% from baseline. Despite multiple attempts, we were not unable to obtain and include weight change data from 11 trials, as they reported data in unusable formats.\u00c2 None of the trials reported on all\u00e2\u0080\u0090cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, non\u00e2\u0080\u0090fatal myocardial infarction, non\u00e2\u0080\u0090fatal stroke and diagnosis of T2DM. This is to be expected\u00c2\u00a0to some degree in view of the practical challenges posed by long durations of follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up in weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diet trials.\u00c2\u00a0Pooled data from long\u00e2\u0080\u0090term prospective cohort studies on dietary carbohydrate intake and mortality have demonstrated harm at the extremes of intake (Seidelmann 2018). Moreover, a range of potential shorter\u00e2\u0080\u0090 and longer\u00e2\u0080\u0090term safety concerns of low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets have been discussed in recent papers, such as reduced dietary intake of fibre, minerals, vitamins, trace elements and polyunsaturated fats, unknown effects of long\u00e2\u0080\u0090term ketosis, harmful environmental impacts and dysbiosis (Barber 2021;\u00c2\u00a0Sievenpiper 2020).\u00c2 The effect of weight reduction per se on cardiovascular risk factors is also important for interpreting this evidence, as it is known that a weight reduction of 5% or more is associated with improvements in cardio metabolic risks, including blood lipids, blood pressure and HbA1c (Brown 2016;\u00c2\u00a0Franz 2015). As we found little to no difference in weight reduction between low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate and balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets up to two years, one would reasonably not expect to find meaningful differences in effects on blood lipids, blood pressure and HbA1c between the two diets, which was the case in our review. Our review did not seek to address effects of differences in the quality of dietary carbohydrates, or the quality of the replacement macronutrients (e.g. fat). Both quality and quantity or proportions are vital components of understanding the effects of macronutrients on health outcomes (Abdelhamid 2018;\u00c2\u00a0Barber 2021;\u00c2\u00a0Hooper 2020;\u00c2\u00a0Reynolds 2019;\u00c2\u00a0Sievenpiper 2020).\u00c2 A criticism of examining mean differences in weight between diet groups is that they do not fully account for true different individual responses, where \u00e2\u0080\u0098true\u00e2\u0080\u0099 refers to individual response differences that are not a result of random trial\u00e2\u0080\u0090to\u00e2\u0080\u0090trial variability. In the context of 'personalised' nutrition, there is interest in ascertaining whether there are true individual differences in the responses to weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets large enough to be clinically relevant. A recent systematic review, using a response variance comparison approach, examined whether the weight responses to low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets or low\u00e2\u0080\u0090fat diets (typically, balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets) differ between individuals, and was unable to detect clinically relevant differences in individual response heterogeneity between the two diets (Smith 2020). All except one of the 61 trials were conducted in high\u00e2\u0080\u0090income countries. There are, however, no obvious reasons to expect the effects of low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets on body weight to be different in people from low\u00e2\u0080\u0090 and middle\u00e2\u0080\u0090income countries. High costs of low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets and disproportionate financial effects on lower socioeconomic groups, which are beyond the scope of our review, have been covered elsewhere (Barber 2021;\u00c2\u00a0Raffensperger 2008). Nearly 40% of included trials reported some or all funding by food/diet industry and related private companies, such as food and nutrition product manufacturers, organisations representing the interests of food producers (e.g. Pork Council, Dairy Farmers Association) and diet book and diet product organisations. There are many individual and environmental factors that influence a person's ability to adhere to weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets, and studies have shown that adherence to weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets is one of the major factors that determine success over the short and long term (Gibson 2017). Systematic reviews and RCTs of low\u00e2\u0080\u0090 and balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets have demonstrated that adherence is a problem, and reduces over time with both diets, with some of these specifically reporting difficulty with adhering to severely carbohydrate\u00e2\u0080\u0090restricted diets over the long term (Foster 2003;\u00c2\u00a0Gibson 2017;\u00c2\u00a0Ross 2021;\u00c2\u00a0Sacks 2009). We did not investigate the possible influence of adherence on the effects of the dietary interventions. However, we did extract information on fidelity for both diets (Characteristics of included studies), i.e. the degree to which an intervention happened in the way the investigators intended it to (Hoffman 2014).\u00c2 Quality of the evidence The interpretation of most weight reduction trials is constrained by small samples, a lack of blinding, and large loss to follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up (Simons\u00e2\u0080\u0090Morton 2006), which were also observed across the trials in our review. None of the trials in the review were judged as having low risk of bias overall. The overall risk of bias of outcomes across trials in participants without and with T2DM was predominantly high, largely due to high proportions of missing outcome data in many trials. Potential biases in the review process The review may be affected by non\u00e2\u0080\u0090reporting bias. For the 'known unknowns' (particular results from a trial not reported in a usable format), we contacted trial authors multiple times to obtain the data in a usable format. Failure to obtain this and consequent exclusion thereof is a limitation of the review process, as we cannot be absolutely certain if and how the inclusion of these data would have affected the pooled estimates. However, given the agreement in pooled mean differences in weight reduction between our review and other similar reviews, we think it is unlikely that these data would have meaningfully changed our pooled estimates. It was harder to make a judgement about the 'unknown unknowns' (entire eligible trials not reported or picked up by our comprehensive searching), but it is possible that small unpublished trials are missing. Interpreting funnel plot asymmetry was challenging since many trials had similar standard errors.\u00c2 We excluded RCTs of less than 12 weeks' duration which may have been relevant to the review question. The reason for choosing only trials with at least 12 weeks follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up was to allow sufficient time to detect clinically meaningful weight and cardiovascular risk factor changes.\u00c2 Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews Pooled mean differences in weight reduction and cardiovascular risk factors in our review are in line with a number of recent systematic reviews with pairwise meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analyses (Chawla 2020;\u00c2\u00a0Dong 2020;\u00c2\u00a0Smith 2020;\u00c2\u00a0Yang 2021), and an older review with network meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analyses (Johnston 2014), in participants without T2DM. This is also the case for recent similar reviews in participants with T2DM (Meng 2017;\u00c2\u00a0Silverii 2020;\u00c2\u00a0Snorgaard 2017;\u00c2\u00a0Van Zuuren 2018). Systematic reviews with varying definitions of low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets and differing eligibility criteria have shown that low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets do not result in superior long\u00e2\u0080\u0090term clinically meaningful weight reduction. An overview of systematic reviews\u00c2\u00a0of RCTs comparing low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate to control diets (low\u00e2\u0080\u0090fat or energy\u00e2\u0080\u0090restricted) in adults with overweight and obesity included\u00c2\u00a012 reviews (10 with meta\u00e2\u0080\u0090analyses) and reported an inverse relationship between number of trial participants and the size of differences in weight loss (Churuangsuk 2018).",
    "CONCL": "Authors' conclusions Implications for practice The small pooled mean differences in weight reduction between the diets (about 1 to 2 kg), while statistically significant in the short term, were not clinically important in the short or long term in an overweight and obese adult, without or with T2DM (low\u00e2\u0080\u0090to moderate\u00e2\u0080\u0090certainty evidence). These differences are similar to typical ranges of biological weight fluctuations over time (Liska 2019;\u00c2\u00a0Vuorinen 2021), and can at least in part be ascribed to biological weight fluctuations, which are influenced by various factors including level of activity, hydration status, season and medications. When interpreting the sizes of the mean differences of weight reduction between the two diets, one should also consider the total body water loss (2 to 3 kg) that follows dietary carbohydrate restriction due to diet\u00e2\u0080\u0090induced diuresis from glycogen depletion and production of ketone bodies, which is restored when carbohydrates are eaten again (Denke 2001;\u00c2\u00a0Yang 1976).\u00c2 Our systematic review failed to show that low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets are superior to balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diets, with little or no difference in weight reduction and cardiovascular risk factors over the short (three to 8.5 months) and long term (one to two years). Trials did not report on our prespecified outcomes after two years of follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up. The range of potential safety concerns of low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets not addressed in this review over the short and longer term should also be considered.\u00c2 Most trials included participants without diagnosed cardiovascular disease or events at baseline, and average baseline LDL cholesterol concentrations and DBP across the trials were within the normal ranges defined for people without coronary artery disease. In people with lipid disorders and variability with atherogenic lipoprotein response, caution in recommending low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate and consequent high\u00e2\u0080\u0090fat diets is warranted. Evidence on participant\u00e2\u0080\u0090reported adverse effects over two years was limited and we could not draw any conclusions about these. Dietary modification is central to weight reduction, however, in view of the complex aetiology of obesity, it is important to consider the demonstrated value of combining diet and other positive lifestyle and behavioural interventions to reduce weight and cardiovascular risk. Current dietary guidance allows for flexibility in the proportion of macronutrients, including a wide range of carbohydrate intakes, with greater emphasis on quality over quantity and on total dietary patterns over single nutrients.\u00c2 Implications for research In view of the challenges associated with weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing diet trials and the similar findings from this and other comparable reviews, it could reasonably be argued that additional trials on this question are not needed. However, the effects of low\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets compared to balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0090carbohydrate diets beyond two years is unknown. If conducted, future trials on this question in participants without and with T2DM, should be longer than two years, adequately powered with greater attention to methodological quality, and specifically the use of more appropriate and rigorous statistical approaches to address loss to follow\u00e2\u0080\u0090up, where relevant. Prospective registration, publication of protocols and of detailed data analysis plans, as well as use of appropriate reporting guidelines (e.g. CONSORT) by future trials, would also be beneficial to the quality and utility of any future research. Other key research areas related to dietary interventions for weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reduction and cardiovascular health include improving dietary adherence, which is critical to both short\u00e2\u0080\u0090 and long\u00e2\u0080\u0090term weight loss, total dietary patterns and macronutrient quality.\u00c2 History Protocol first published: Issue 5, 2019 Risk of bias",

Recruitment Status is ALL Data and analyses Characteristics of studies Characteristics of included studies [ordered by study ID] Characteristics of excluded studies [ordered by study ID] Characteristics of studies awaiting classification [ordered by study ID] Characteristics of ongoing studies [ordered by study ID] Differences between protocol and review We added the outcome, change in weight at three to < 12 months, to the list of outcomes for inclusion in the summary of findings tables. After inputs from clinicians, recent studies and people wanting to follow weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reduction diets, we considered short\u00e2\u0080\u0090term weight reduction to be a clinician\u00e2\u0080\u0090 and patient\u00e2\u0080\u0090important outcome.\u00c2 We included four comparisons instead of two as stated in the protocol. This was done in order to separate findings where people implemented only an active weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phase of the diets, from findings where people implemented a weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090reducing phase followed by weight\u00e2\u0080\u0090maintenance phases of the diets (periods where initial diet prescriptions or advice changed to indicate less focus on active weight reduction, for example, changes in energy prescriptions or no restrictions on carbohydrate intake). We changed one of the sensitivity analyses from \"attrition bias (i.e. first pool all relevant studies per outcome, and then pool only studies with < 15% missing data from the total initial sample)\" to \"first pool all relevant studies per outcome, and then pool only studies with low or some concerns for bias due to missing outcome data (domain 3 in the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool).\" We excluded the adherence assessment detailed in our protocol as we did not deem it relevant for a review aiming to assess assignment to intervention.",
